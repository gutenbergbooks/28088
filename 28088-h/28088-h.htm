<h2><br /><br /><br /><br /><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day preceding Beth's birth was a grey day, a serene grey day,
awesome with a certain solemnity, and singularly significant to those
who seek a sign. There is a quiet mood, an inner calm, to which a grey
day adds peculiar solace. It is like the relief which follows after
tears, when hope begins to revive, and the warm blood throbs
rebelliously to be free of the shackles of grief; a certain heaviness
still lingers, but only as a luxurious languor which is a pleasure in
itself. In other moods, however, in pain, in doubt, in suspense, the
grey day deepens the depression of the spirits, and also adds to the
sense of physical discomfort. Mrs. Caldwell, looking up at noon from the
stocking she was mending, and seeing only a slender strip of level gloom
above the houses opposite, suddenly experienced a mingled feeling of
chilliness and dread, and longed for a fire, although the month was
June. She could not afford fires at that time of year, yet she thought
how nice it would be to have one, and the more she thought of it the
more chilly she felt. A little comfort of the kind would have meant so
much to her that morning. She would like to have felt it right to put
away the mending, sit by a good blaze with a book, and absorb herself in
somebody else's thoughts, for her own were far from cheerful. She was
weak and ill and anxious, the mother of six children already, and about
to produce a seventh on an income that would have been insufficient for
four. It was a reckless thing for a delicate woman to do, but she never
thought of that. She lived in the days when no one thought of the waste
of women in this respect, and they had not begun to think for
themselves. What she suffered she accepted as her "lot," or "The Will of
God"&mdash;the expression varied with the nature of the trouble; extreme pain
was "The Will of God," but minor discomforts and worries were her "lot."
That much of the misery was perfectly preventable never occurred to her,
and if any one had suggested such a thing she would have been shocked.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
The parson in the pulpit preached endurance; and she understood that
anything in the nature of resistance, any discussion even of social
problems, would not only have been a flying in the face of Providence,
but a most indecent proceeding. She knew that there was crime and
disease in the world, but there were judges and juries to pursue
criminals, doctors to deal with diseases, and the clergy to speak a word
in season to all, from the murderer on the scaffold to the maid who had
misconducted herself. There was nothing eccentric about Mrs. Caldwell;
she accepted the world just as she found it, and was satisfied to know
that effects were being dealt with. Causes she never considered, because
she knew nothing about them.</p>

<p>But she was ill at ease that morning, and did think it rather hard that
she should not have had time to recover from her last illness. She
acknowledged to herself that she was very weak, that it was hard to drag
the darning-needle through that worn stocking, and, oh dear! the holes
were so many and so big that week, and there were such quantities of
other things to be done, clothes mended and made for the children,
besides household matters to be seen to generally; why wasn't she
strong? That was the only thing she repined about, poor woman, her want
of physical strength. She would work until she dropped, however, and
mortal man could expect no more of her, she assured herself with a sigh
of satisfaction, in anticipation of the inevitable event which would lay
her by, and so release her from all immediate responsibility. Worn and
weary working mothers, often uncomplaining victims of the cruelest
exactions, toilers whose day's work is never done, no wonder they
welcome even the illness which enforces rest in bed, the one holiday
that is ever allowed them. Mrs. Caldwell thought again of the fire and
the book. She had read a good deal at one time, and had even been able
to play, and sing, and draw, and paint with a dainty touch; but since
her marriage, the many children, the small means, and the failing
strength had made all such pursuits an impossible luxury. The fire and
the book&mdash;who knows what they might not have meant, what a benign
difference the small relaxation allowed to the mother at this critical
time might not have made in the temperament of the child? Perhaps, if we
could read the events even of that one day aright, we should find in
them the clue to all that was inexplicable in its subsequent career.</p>

<p>In deciding that she could not afford a fire for herself, Mrs. Caldwell
had glanced round the room, and noticed that the whisky bottle on the
sideboard was all but empty. She got up hastily, and went into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"I had quite forgotten the whisky," she said to the maid-of-all-work,
who was scraping potatoes at the sink. "Your master

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> will be so put out
if there isn't enough. You must go at once and get some&mdash;six bottles.
Bring one with you, and let them send the rest."</p>

<p>The girl turned upon her with a scowl. "And who's to do my dinner?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can," Mrs. Caldwell answered. The servant threw the
knife down on the potatoes, and turned from the sink sullenly, wiping
her hands on her apron as she went.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell rolled up her sleeves, and set to work, but awkwardly.
Household work comes naturally to many educated women; they like it, and
they do it well; but Mrs. Caldwell was not one of this kind. She was not
made for labour, but for luxury; her hands and arms, both delicately
beautiful in form and colour, alone showed that. Her whole air betokened
gentle birth and breeding. She looked out of place in the kitchen, and
it was evident that she could only acquit herself well among the
refinements of life. She set to work with a will, however, for she had
the pluck and patience of ten men. She peeled vegetables, chopped meat,
fetched water, carried coals to mend the fire, did all that had to be
done to the best of her ability, although she had to cling many times to
table, or chair, or dresser, to recover from the exertion, and brace
herself for a fresh attempt. When she had done in the kitchen she went
to the dining-room and laid the cloth. The sulky servant did not hurry
back. She had a trick of lingering long on errands, and when at last she
did appear she brought no whisky.</p>

<p>"They're going to send it," she explained. "They promised to send it at
once."</p>

<p>"But I told you to bring a bottle!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed, stamping
her foot imperiously.</p>

<p>The girl walked off to the kitchen, and slammed the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell's forehead was puckered with a frown, but she got out the
mending again, and sat down to it in the dining-room with dogged
determination.</p>

<p>Presently there was a step outside. She looked up and listened. The
front door opened. Her worn face brightened; backache and weariness were
forgotten; her husband had come home; and it was as if the clouds had
parted and the sun shone forth.</p>

<p>She looked up brightly to greet him. "You've got your work over early
to-day," she said.</p>

<p>"I have," he answered drily, without looking at her.</p>

<p>The smile froze on her lips. He had come back in an irritable mood. He
went to the sideboard when he had spoken, and poured himself out a stiff
glass of whisky-and-water, which he carried to the window, where he
stood with his back to his wife,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
 looking out. He was a short man, who
made an instant impression of light eyes in a dark face. You would have
looked at him a second time in the street, and thought of him after he
had passed, so striking was the peculiar contrast. His features were
European, but his complexion, and his soft glossy black hair, curling
close and crisp to the head, betrayed a dark drop in him, probably
African. In the West Indies he would certainly have been set down as a
quadroon. There was no record of negro blood in the family, however, no
trace of any ancestor who had lived abroad; and the three moors' heads
with ivory rings through their noses which appeared in one quarter of
the scutcheon were always understood by later generations to have been a
distinction conferred for some special butchery-business among the
Saracens.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell glanced at her husband, as he stood with his back to her
in the window, and then went on with the mending, patiently waiting till
the mood should have passed off, or she should have thought of something
with which to beguile him.</p>

<p>When he had finished the whisky-and-water, he turned and looked at her
with critical disapprobation.</p>

<p>"I wonder why it is when a woman marries she takes no more pains with
herself," he ejaculated. "When I married you, you were one of the
smartest girls I ever saw."</p>

<p>"It would be difficult to be smart just now," she answered.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of impatience. "But why should a woman give up
everything when she marries? You had more accomplishments than most of
them, and now all you do, it seems to me, is the mending."</p>

<p>"The mending must be done," she answered deprecatingly, "and I'm not
very strong. I'm not able to do everything. I would if I could."</p>

<p>There was a wild stampede at this moment. The four elder children had
returned from school, and the two younger ones from a walk with their
nurse, and now burst into the room, in wild spirits, demanding dinner.
It was the first bright moment of the morning for their mother, but her
husband promptly spoilt her pleasure.</p>

<p>"Sit down at table," he roared, "and don't let me hear another word from
any of you. A man comes home to be quiet, and this is the kind of thing
that awaits him!"</p>

<p>The children shrank to their places abashed, while their mother escaped
to the kitchen to hurry the dinner. The form&mdash;or farce&mdash;of grace was
gone through before the meal commenced. The children ate greedily, but
were obediently silent. All the little confidences and remarks which it
would have been so healthy for them to make, and so good for their
mother to hear, had to be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
 suppressed, and the silence and constraint
made everyone dyspeptic. The dinner consisted of only one dish, a hash,
which Mrs. Caldwell had made because her husband had liked it so much
the last time they had had it. He turned it over on his plate now,
however, ominously, blaming the food for his own want of appetite. Mrs.
Caldwell knew the symptoms, and sighed.</p>

<p>"I can't eat this stuff," he said at last, pushing his plate away from
him.</p>

<p>"There's a pudding coming," his wife replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, a pudding!" he exclaimed. "I know what our puddings are. Why aren't
women taught something sensible? What's the use of all your
accomplishments if you can't cook the simplest dish? What a difference
it would have made to my life if you had been able to make pastry even."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell thought of the time she had spent on her feet in the
kitchen that morning doing her best, and she also thought how easy it
would have been for him to marry a woman who could cook, if that were
all he wanted; but she had no faint glimmering conception that it was
unreasonable to expect a woman of her class to cook her dinner as well
as eat it. One servant is not expected to do another's work in any
establishment; but a mother on a small income, the most cruelly tried of
women, is too often required to be equal to anything. Mrs. Caldwell said
nothing, however. She belonged to the days when a wife's meek submission
to anything a man chose to say made nagging a pleasant relaxation for
the man, and encouraged him to persevere until he acquired a peculiar
ease in the art, and spoilt the tempers of everybody about him.</p>

<p>The arrival of the family doctor put an end to the scene. Mrs. Caldwell
told the children to run away, and her husband's countenance cleared.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, Gottley," he said. "What will you have?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, thank you. I can't stay a moment. I just looked in to see
how Mrs. Caldwell was getting on."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's all right," her husband answered for her cheerfully. "How are
you all, especially Miss Bessie?"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" said the old gentleman, sitting down by the table. "That
reminds me I'm not on good terms with Bessie this morning. I'm generally
careful, you know, but it seems I said something disrespectful about a
Christian brother&mdash;a <i>Christian</i> brother, mind you&mdash;and I've been had up
before the family tribunal for blasphemy, and condemned to everlasting
punishment. Lord!&mdash;But, mark my words," he exclaimed emphatically, "a
time will come when every school-girl will see, what my life is made a
burden to me for seeing now, the absurdity of the whole religious
superstition."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"O doctor!" Mrs. Caldwell cried, "surely you believe in God?"</p>

<p>"God has not revealed Himself to me, madam; I know nothing about Him,"
the old gentleman answered gently.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you know you are wrong, Gottley," Mr. Caldwell chimed in, and
then he proceeded to argue the question. The old doctor, being in a
hurry, said little in reply, and when he had gone Mrs. Caldwell
exclaimed, with wifely tact&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I think you had the best of that!"</p>

<p>"Well, I think I had, poor old buffer!" her husband answered
complacently, his temper restored. "By the way, I've brought in the last
number of Dickens. Shall I read it to you?"</p>

<p>Her face brightened. "Yes, do," she rejoined. "One moment, till Jane has
done clearing the table. Here's your chair," and she placed the only
easy one in the room for him, in the best light.</p>

<p>These readings were one of the joys of her life. He read to her often,
and read exceedingly well. Books were the bond of union between them,
the prop and stay of their married life. Poor as they were, they always
managed to find money for new ones, which they enjoyed together in this
way. Intellectuality balanced the morbid irritability of the husband's
temperament, and literature made life tolerable to them both as nothing
else could have done. As he read now, his countenance cleared, and his
imaginary cares fell from him; while his wife's very real ones were
forgotten as she listened, and there was a blessed truce to trouble for
a time. Unfortunately, however, as the reading proceeded, he came to a
rasping bit of the story, which began to grate upon his nerves. The
first part had been pleasurably exciting, but when he found the
sensation slipping from him, he thought to stay it with a stimulant, and
went to the sideboard for the purpose. Mrs. Caldwell's heart sank; the
whisky bottle was all but empty.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it!" he exclaimed, banging it down on the sideboard. "And I
suppose there is none in the house. There never is any in the house. No
one looks after anything. My comfort is never considered. It is always
those damned children."</p>

<p>"Henry!" his wife protested; but she was too ill to defend herself
further.</p>

<p>"What a life for a man," he proceeded; "stuck down in this cursed hole,
without a congenial soul to speak to, in or out of the house."</p>

<p>"That is a cruel thing to say, Henry," she remonstrated with dignity.</p>

<p>"Well, I apologise," he rejoined ungraciously. "But you must confess
that I have some cause to complain."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>He was standing behind her as he spoke, and she felt that he eyed her
the while with disapproval of her appearance, and anger at her
condition. She knew the look only too well, poor soul, and her attitude
was deprecating as she sat there gazing up pitifully at the strip of
level greyness above the houses opposite. She said nothing, however,
only rocked herself on her chair, and looked forlornly miserable; seeing
which brought his irritation to a climax. He flung the book across the
room; but even in the act, his countenance cleared. He was standing in
the window, and caught a glimpse of Bessie Gottley, who was passing at
the moment on the opposite side of the road, and looked across at him,
smiling and nodding invitingly. Mrs. Caldwell saw the pantomime, and her
heart contracted with a pang when she saw how readily her husband
responded. It was hard that the evil moods should not be conquered for
her as well as for Bessie Gottley.</p>

<p>Bridget came in just then, bringing the belated whisky.</p>

<p>"Oh, you did order it," he graciously acknowledged. "Why didn't you say
so?" He opened the bottle, and poured some out for himself. "Here's to
the moon-faced Bessie!" he said jocularly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell went on with the mending. Her husband began to walk up and
down the room, in a good humour again. He walked peculiarly, more on his
toes than his heels, with an odd little spring in each step, as if it
were the first step of a dance. This springiness gave to his gait a sort
of buoyancy which might have seemed natural to him, if exaggerated, in
his youth, but had the air of an affectation in middle life, as if it
were part of an assumption of juvenility.</p>

<p>"Won't you go on with the reading?" his wife said at last. His
restlessness worried her.</p>

<p>"No," he answered; "I shall go out. I want exercise."</p>

<p>"When will you be back?" she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it all! don't nag me. I shall come back when I like."</p>

<p>He left the room as he spoke, slamming the door behind him. Mrs.
Caldwell did not alter her attitude, but the tears welled up in her
eyes, and ran down her haggard cheeks unheeded. The children came in,
and finding her so, quietly left the room, all but the eldest girl, who
went and leant against her, slipping her little hand through her
mother's arm. The poor woman kissed the child passionately; then, with a
great effort, recovered her self-control, put her work away, gave the
children their tea, read to them for an hour, and saw them to bed. The
front door was open when she came downstairs, and she went to shut it. A
lady, who knew her, happened to be passing, and stopped to shake hands.
"I saw your husband just now sitting on the beach with Bessie Gottley,"
she informed Mrs. Caldwell pleasantly. "They were both laughing
immoderately."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very likely," Mrs. Caldwell responded with a smile. "She amuses my
husband immensely. But won't you come in?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. Not to-night. I am hurrying home. Glad to see you
looking so well;" with which she nodded, and went her way; and Mrs.
Caldwell returned to the little dining-room, holding her head high till
she had shut the door, when she burst into a tempest of tears. She was a
lymphatic woman ordinarily, but subject to sudden squalls of passion,
when she lost all self-control.</p>

<p>She would have sobbed aloud now, when the fit was on her, in the face of
the whole community, although the constant effort of her life was to
keep up appearances. She had recovered herself, however, before the
servant came in with the candles, and was sitting in the window looking
out anxiously. The greyness of the long June day was darkening down to
night now, but there was no change in the sultry stillness of the air.
Summer lightning played about in the strip of sky above the houses
opposite. One of the houses was a butcher's shop, and while Mrs.
Caldwell sat there, the butcher brought out a lamb and killed it. Mrs.
Caldwell watched the operation with interest. They did strange things in
those days in that little Irish seaport, and, being an Englishwoman, she
looked on like a civilised traveller intelligently studying the customs
of a savage people.</p>

<p>But as the darkness gathered, the trouble of her mind increased. Her
husband did not return, and a sickening sensation of dread took
possession of her. Where had he gone? What was he doing? Doubtless
enjoying himself&mdash;what bitterness there was in the thought! She did not
grudge him any pleasure, but it was hard that he should find so little
in her company. Why was there no distraction for her? The torment of her
mind was awful; should she try his remedy? She went to the sideboard and
poured herself out some whisky, but even as she raised it to her lips
she felt it unworthy to have recourse to it, and put the glass down
untouched.</p>

<p>After that she went and leant against the window-frame. It was about
midnight, and very few people passed. Whenever a man appeared in the
distance, she had a moment of hope, but only to be followed by the
sickening sensation of another disappointment. The mental anguish was so
great that for some time she paid no attention to physical symptoms
which had now begun. By degrees, however, these became importunate, and
oh the relief of it! The trouble of her mind ceased when the physical
pain became acute, and therefore she welcomed it as a pleasant
distraction. She was obliged to think and be practical too; there was no
one in the house to help her. The sleeping children were of course out
of the question, and the two young

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> servants, maid-of-all-work and
nurse, nearly as much so. Besides, there was the difficulty of calling
them. She felt she must not disturb Jane who was in the nursery, for
fear of rousing the children; but should she ever get to Bridget's room,
which was further off? Step by step she climbed the stairs, clinging to
the banister with one hand, holding the candle in the other. Several
times she sank down and waited silently, but with contracted face, till
a paroxysm had passed. At last she reached the door. Bridget was awake
and had heard her coming. "Holy Mother!" she exclaimed, startled out of
her habitual sullenness by her mistress's agonised face. "Yer ill,
ma'am! Let me help you to your bed!"</p>

<p>"Fetch the doctor and the nurse, Bridget," Mrs. Caldwell was just able
to gasp.</p>

<p>In the urgency and excitement of the moment, there was a truce to
hostilities. Bridget jumped up, in night-dress and bare feet, and
supported her mistress to her room. There she was obliged to leave her
alone; and so it happened that, just as the grey dawn trembled with the
first flush of a new and brighter day, the child arrived unassisted and
without welcome, and sent up a wail of protest. When the doctor came at
last, and had time to attend to her, he pronounced her to be a fine
child, and declared that she had made a good beginning, and would do
well for herself, which words the nurse declared to be of happy omen.
Her father was not fit to appear until late in the day. He came in
humbly, filled with remorse for that mis-spent night, and was received
with the feeble flicker of a smile, which so touched and softened him
that he made more of the new child, and took a greater interest in her
than he had done in any of the others at the time of their birth. There
was some difficulty about a name for her. Her father proposed to call
her Elizabeth&mdash;after his sister, he said&mdash;but Mrs. Caldwell objected.
Elizabeth was Miss Gottley's name also, a fact which she recollected,
but did not mention. That she did not like the name seemed reason enough
for not choosing it; but her husband persisted, and then there was a hot
dispute on the subject above the baby's cradle. The dispute ended in a
compromise, the mother agreeing to have the child christened Elizabeth
if she were not called so; and she would not have her called Eliza,
Elsie, Elspeth, Bessie, Betsy, or Bess either. This left nothing for it
but to call her Beth, and upon consideration both parents liked the
diminutive, her father because it was unaccustomed, and her mother
because it had no association of any kind attached to it.</p>

<p>For the first three months of her life Beth cried incessantly, as if
bewailing her advent. Then, one day, she opened her eyes wide, and
looked out into the world with interest.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the sunshine really that first called her into conscious
existence, the blessed heat and light; up to the moment that she
recognised these with a certain acknowledgment of them, and consequently
of things in general outside herself, she had been as unconscious as a
white grub without legs. But that moment roused her, calling forth from
her senses their first response in the thrill of warmth and well-being
to which she awoke, and quickening her intellect at the same time with
the stimulating effort to discover from whence her comfort came. She
could remember no circumstance in connection with this earliest
awakening. All she knew of it was the feeling of warmth and brightness,
which she said recurred to her at odd times ever afterwards, and could
be recalled at will.</p>

<p>Some may see in this first awakening a foreshadowing of the fact that
she was born to be a child of light, and to live in it; and certainly it
was always light for which she craved, the actual light of day, however;
but nothing she yearned for ever came to her in the form she thought of,
and thus, when she asked for sunshine it was grudgingly given, fate
often forcing her into dark dwellings; but all the time that light which
illumines the spirit was being bestowed upon her in limitless measure.</p>

<p>The next step in her awakening was to a kind of self-consciousness. She
was lying on her nurse's lap out of doors, looking up at the sky, and
some one was saying, "Oh, you pretty thing!" But it was long years
before she connected the phrase with herself, although she smiled in
response to the voice that uttered it. Then she found herself on her
feet in a garden, moving very carefully for fear of falling; and
everything about her was gigantic, from Jane Nettles, the nurse, at
whose skirt she tugged when she wanted to attract attention, to the
brown wallflower and the purple larkspur which she could not reach to
pull. There was a thin hedge at the end of the garden, through which she
looked out on a path across a field, and a thick hedge on her left, in
which a thrush had built a nest at an immense height above her head.
Jane lifted her up to look into the nest, and there was nothing in it;
then Jane lifted her up again, and, oh! there was a blue egg there; and
Jane lifted her up a third time, and the egg had brown spots on it. The
mystery of the egg awed her. She did not ask herself how it came to be
there, but she felt a solemn wonder in the fact, and the colour caused a
sensation of pleasure, a positive thrill, to run through her. This was
her first recognition of beauty, and it was to the beauty of colour, not
of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
 form, that her senses awoke! Through life she had a keen joy and
nice discrimination in colours, and seemed to herself to have always
known their names.</p>

<p>But those spots on the egg. She was positive that they had come between
her first and second peep, which shows how defective her faculty of
observation, which became so exact under cultivation, was to begin with.
Beth also betrayed other traits with regard to the spots, which she
carried through life&mdash;the trick of being most positive when she was
quite in the wrong, for one; and want of faith in other people, for
another.</p>

<p>Jane said: "Did you see the spots that time, dearie?"</p>

<p>"Spots just comed," Beth declared.</p>

<p>"No, dearie, spots always there," Jane answered.</p>

<p>"Spots <i>comed</i>," Beth maintained.</p>

<p>"No, dearie. Spots always there, only you didn't see them."</p>

<p>"Spots comed <i>now</i>!" Beth stamped, and then, because Jane shook her
head, she sat down suddenly on the gravel, and sent up a howl which
brought her father out. He chucked Jane under the chin. Jane giggled,
then made a sign; and there was Mrs. Caldwell looking from one to the
other.</p>

<p>To Beth's recollection it seemed as if she had rapidly acquired the
experiences of this first period. Each incident that she remembered is
apparently trifling in itself, but who can say of what significance as
an indication? In those first few years, had there been any there with
intelligence to interpret, they probably would have found foreshadowings
of all she might be, and do, and suffer; and that would have been the
time to teach her. To me, therefore, these earliest impressions are more
interesting than much that occurred to her in after life, and I have
carefully collected them in the hope of finding some clue in them to
what followed. In several instances it seems to me that the impression
left by some chance observation or incident on her baby mind, made it
possible for her to do many things in after life which she certainly
never would have done but for those early influences. It would be
affectation, therefore, to apologise for such detail. Nothing can be
trivial or insignificant that tends to throw light on the mysterious
growth of our moral and intellectual being. Many a cramped soul that
struggles on in after years, vainly endeavouring to rise on a broken
wing, might, had the importance of such seeming trifles in its
development been recognised, have won its way upward from the first,
untrammelled and uninjured. It was a Jesuit, was it not, who said: "Give
me the child until it is six years old; after that you can do as you
like with it." That is the time to make an indelible impression of
principles upon the mind. In the first period of life, character is a
blossom that should be carefully touched; in the second

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> the petals
fall, and the fruit sets; it is hard and acrid then until the third
period, when, if things go well, it will ripen on the bough, and be
sweet and wholesome&mdash;if ill, it will drop off immediately, and rot upon
the ground.</p>

<p>Beth was a combative child, always at war with Jane. There was a great
battle fought about a big black velvet bonnet that Beth wanted to wear
one day. Beth screamed and kicked and scratched and bit, and finally
went out in the bonnet triumphantly, and found herself standing alone on
the edge of a great green world dotted with yellow gorse. A hot, wide
dusty road stretched miles away in front of her; and at an infinite
distance overhead was the blue sky flecked with clouds so white and
dazzling that her eyes ached when she looked at them. She had stopped a
moment to cry, "Wait for me!" Jane walked on, however, taking no notice,
and Beth struggled after her, whimpering, out of breath, choked with
dust, scorched with heat, parched with thirst, tired to death&mdash;how she
suffered! A heartless lark sang overhead, regardless of her misery: and
she never afterwards heard a lark without recalling the long white road,
the heat, and dust, and fatigue. She tore off the velvet bonnet, and
threw it away, then began another despairing "Wait for me!" But in the
midst of the cry she saw some little yellow flowers growing in the grass
at the roadside, and plumped down then and there inconsequently to
gather them. By that time Jane was out of sight; and at the moment Beth
became aware of the fact, she also perceived an appalling expanse of
bright blue sky above her, and sat, gazing upwards, paralysed with
terror. This was her first experience of loneliness, her first terrified
sensation of immensity.</p>

<p>Then the snowdrops and crocuses were out, and the sky grew black, and
she sat on the nursery floor and looked up at it in solemn wonder.
Flakes of snow began to fall, a few at first, then thicker and thicker,
till the air was full of them, and Jane said, "The Scotch are picking
their geese," and immediately Beth saw the Scotch sitting in some vague
scene, picking geese in frenzied haste, and throwing great handfuls of
feathers up in the air; which was probably the first independent flight
of her imagination.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how little consciousness of time there is in these
reminiscences. The seasons are all confounded, and it is as if things
had happened not in succession but abreast. There was snow on the ground
when her brother Jim was with her in the wash-house, making horse-hair
snares to catch birds. They made running loops of the horse-hair, and
tied them on to sticks, then went out and stuck them in the ground in
the garden outside the wash-house window, sprinkled crumbs of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> bread,
and crept carefully back to watch. First came a robin with noiseless
flight, and lit on the ground with its head on one side; but the
children were too eager, and in their excitement they made a noise, and
the robin flew away. Next came a sparrow, saw the children, saw the
crumbs, and, with the habitual self-possession of his race, stretched in
his head between the sticks, picked out the largest piece of bread, and
carried it off in triumph. Immediately afterwards a blackbird flew down,
and hopped in among the snares unconsciously. In a moment he was caught,
and, with a wild shout of joy, the children rushed out to secure their
prize; but when they reached the spot the blackbird had burst his bonds
and escaped. Then Beth threw a chunk of wood at her brother, and cut his
head open. His cries brought out the household, and Beth was well
shaken&mdash;she was always being shaken at this time&mdash;and marched off
promptly to papa's dressing-room, and made to sit on a little chair in
the middle of the floor, where she amused herself by singing at the top
of her voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All around Sebastopol,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">All around the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Every time a gun goes off,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Down falls a Russian."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She wondered why her father and mother were laughing when they came to
release her. Before they appeared, however, brother Jim, her victim, had
come to the door with his head tied up, and peeped in; and she knew that
they were friends again, because he shot ripe gooseberries at her across
the floor as if they had been marbles. There is a discrepancy here,
seeing that snow and ripe gooseberries are not in season at the same
time. It is likely, however, that she broke her brother's head more than
once, and the occasions became confounded in her recollection.</p>

<p>When the children went to bathe off the beach, Beth would not let Jane
dip her if kicking, scratching, and screaming could prevent it. There
used to be terrible scenes between them, until at last one day somebody
else's old Scotch nurse interfered, and persuaded Beth to go into the
water with her and consent to be dipped three times. Beth went like a
lamb&mdash;instead of having to be dragged in and pushed under, given no time
to recover her breath between each dip, half choked with sand and salt
water, and finally dragged out, exhausted by the struggle, and certainly
suffering more than she had benefited by the immersion. The cold water
came up about her and took her breath away as the old Scotch nurse led
her in, and Beth clung to her hand and panted "Wait!" as she nerved
herself for the dip. Nurse had promised to wait until Beth was ready,
and it was Beth's faith

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
 in her promise that gave her courage to go
bravely through the ordeal. The old Scotch nurse never deceived her as
Jane had done, and so Beth learnt that there are people in the world you
can depend on.</p>

<p>There was one painful circumstance in connection with those battles on
the beach. Beth was such a tiny girl, they did not think it necessary to
give her a bathing dress, and consequently she was marched into the
water with nothing on; and the agony of shame she suffered is
indescribable. But the worst of it was, the shame wore off. Jim teased
her about it and called her "a little girl," a dreadful term of reproach
in those days, when the boys were taught to consider themselves superior
beings. Beth flew at him, and fought him for it, but was beaten; and
then she took off her things in the nursery, and scampered up and down
before them all, with nothing on, just to show how little she cared.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how small a part Beth's family play in these childish
recollections. Her father took very little notice of the children. He
was out of health and irritable, and only tried to save himself
annoyance; not to disturb him was the object of everybody's life.
Probably he only appeared on the scene when Beth was naughty, and the
recollection, being painful, was quickly banished. She remembered him
coming downstairs when she was standing in the hall one day, when her
mother was away from home. He had a letter in his hand, and asked her if
she would send her love to mamma. Her heart bounded; it seemed to her
such a tremendous thing to be asked; and she was dying to send her love;
but such an agony of shyness came upon her, she could not utter a word.
She had a little hymn-book in her hand, however, which she held out to
her father. No, that would not do. He could not send the book, only her
love. Didn't she love mamma? Didn't she! But not a word would come.</p>

<p>All through life she was afflicted with that inability to speak at
critical times. Dumb always was she apt to be when her affections were
concerned, except occasionally, in moments of strong excitement; and in
anger, when she was driven to bay. The intensity of her feelings would
probably have made her dumb in any case in moments of emotion; but
doubtless the hardness of those about her at this impressionable period
strengthened the defect. It is impossible to escape from the hampering
influences of our infancy. Among Beth's many recollections of these
days, there was not one of a caress given or received, or of any
expression of tenderness; and so she never became familiar with the
exquisite language of love, and was long in learning that it is not a
thing to be ashamed of and concealed.</p>

<p>Later that day, with a mighty effort, she summoned up courage

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> enough to
go down to her father. She was determined to send the message to mamma;
but when it came to the point, she was again unable to utter a word on
the subject. Her mother had gone to stay with her relations in England.
Beth found her father in the dining-room, and several other people were
present. He was standing by the sideboard, mixing whisky-and-water, so,
instead of sending her love to mamma, Beth exclaimed, confidently and
pleasantly, "If you drink whisky, you'll be drunk again."</p>

<p>A smart slap rewarded this sally. Beth turned pale and recoiled. It was
her first taste of human injustice. To drink and to be drunk was to her
merely the natural sequence of cause and effect, and she could not
conceive why she should be slapped and turned out of the room so
promptly for uttering such a simple truth.</p>

<p>Beth was present at many discussions between her father and mother, and
took much interest in them, all the more perhaps, because most of what
was said was a mystery to her. She wondered why any mention of the
"moon-faced Bessie" disturbed her mother's countenance. Jane Nettles,
too&mdash;when her mother was out, her father used to come and talk to Jane,
and they laughed a good deal. He admired Jane's white teeth, and the
children used to make Jane show them her teeth after that.</p>

<p>"Papa says Jane's got nice white teeth," Beth said to her mother one
day, and she never forgot the glance which Mrs. Caldwell threw at her
husband. His eyes fell before it.</p>

<p>"What! even the servants, Henry!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed, and then she
left the room. Beth learned what it all meant in after years, the career
of one of her brothers furnishing the clue. Like father, like son.</p>

<p>It was after this that Mrs. Caldwell went to visit her relations in
England, accompanied by two of the children. It was in the summer, and
Jane took Beth to the Castle Hill that morning to see the steamer, with
her mother on board, go by. The sea was iridescent, like molten silver,
the sky was high and cloudless, and where sea and sky met and mingled on
the horizon it was impossible to determine. Numbers of steamers passed
far out. They looked quite small, and Beth did not think there was room
in any of them for her mother and brother and sister. They did not,
therefore, interest her much, nor did the policeman who came and talked
to Jane. But the Castle Hill, and the little winding path up which she
had come, the green of the grass, the brambles, the ferns, the ruined
masonry against which she leant, the union of sea and sky and shore, the
light, the colour, absorbed her, and drew her out of herself. Her soul
expanded, it spread its wings, it stretched out spiritual arms to meet
and clasp the beloved nature of which it felt itself to be a part. It
was her earliest

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
 recognition of their kinship, a glimpse of greatness,
a moment of ecstasy never to be forgotten, the first stirring in herself
of the creative faculty, for in her joy she burst out into a little
song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Far on the borders of the Arcane."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was as if the pleasure played upon her, using her as a passive
instrument by which it attained to audible expression. For how should a
child know a word like Arcane? It came to her as things do which we have
known and forgotten&mdash;the whole song did in fact; but she held it as a
possession sacred to herself, and never recorded it, or told more than
that one line, although it stayed with her, lingered on her lips, and in
her heart, for the rest of her life. It was a great moment for Beth, the
moment when her further faculty first awoke. On looking back to it in
after years, she fancied she found in it confirmation of an opinion
which she afterwards formed. Genius to her was yet only another word for
soul. She could not believe that we all have souls, or that they are at
all equally developed even in those who have obtained them. She was a
child under six at this time, Jane Nettles was a woman between twenty
and thirty, and the policeman&mdash;she could not say what age he was; but
she was the only one of the three that throbbed responsive to the beauty
of the wonderful scene before them, or felt her being flooded with the
glory of the hour.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what her parents would have called her education had begun.
She went with Mildred, her elder sister, to a day school. They used to
run down the street together without a nurse, and the sense of freedom
was delicious to Beth. They had to pass the market where the great mealy
specimen potatoes were displayed, and Mary Lynch's shop&mdash;she was the
vegetable woman, who used to talk to Mrs. Caldwell about the children
when they went there, and one or the other always called them "poor
little bodies," upon which they commented afterwards among themselves.
Mary Lynch was a large red-faced woman, and when the children wanted to
describe a stout person they always said, "As fat as Mary Lynch." One
house which Beth had to pass on her way to school made a strong
impression on her imagination. It was a gloomy abode with a broad
doorstep and deep portico, broken windows, and a mud-splashed door, from
beneath which she always expected to see a slender stream of blood
slowly trickling. For a man called Macgregor had murdered his wife
there&mdash;beaten her brains out with a poker. Beth never heard the name
Macgregor in after life without a shiver of dislike. Much of her time at
school was spent in solitary confinement for breaches of the peace. With
a face as impassive as a monkey's she would do the most mischievous
things, and was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
 always experimenting in naughty tricks, as on one
occasion when Miss Deeble left the schoolroom for a minute, but had to
come hurrying back, recalled by wild shrieks; and found that Beth had
managed in that minute to tip up a form with four children on it, throw
their books out of the window, and sprinkle ink all over the floor. Miss
Deeble marched her downstairs to an empty kitchen, and left her sitting
on a stool in the middle of it with an A B C in her hand. But Beth took
no interest in the alphabet in those days, and hunted black-beetles with
the bellows instead of learning it. The hearthstone was the place of
execution. When she found a beetle, she would blow him along to it with
the bellows, and there despatch him. She had no horror of any creature
in her childhood, but as she matured, her whole temperament changed in
this respect, and when she met a beetle on the stairs she would turn and
fly rather than pass it, and she would feel nauseated, and shiver with
disgust for hours after if she thought of it. She knew the exact moment
that this horror came upon her; it happened when she was ten years old.
She found a beetle one day lying on its back, and thinking it was dead,
she took it up, and was swinging it by its antenn&aelig; when the creature
suddenly wriggled itself round, and twined its prickly legs about her
finger, giving her a start from which she never recovered.</p>

<p>Beth probably got as far as A B ab, while she was at Miss Deeble's; but
if she were backward with her book, her other faculties began to be
acute. It was down in that empty kitchen that she first felt the
enchantment of music. Some one suddenly played the piano overhead and
Beth listened spell-bound. Again and again the player played, and always
the same thing, practising it. Beth knew every note. Long afterwards she
was trying some waltzes of Chopin's, and came upon one with which she
was quite familiar. She knew that she had heard it all, over and over
again, but could not think when or where. Presently, however, as she
played it, she perceived a smell of black-beetles, and instantly she was
back in that disused kitchen of Miss Deeble's, listening to the
practising overhead.</p>

<p>All Beth's senses were acute, and from the first her memory helped
itself by the involuntary association of incongruous ideas. Many
people's recollections are stimulated by the sense of smell, but it is a
rarer thing for the sense of taste to be associated with the past in the
same way, as it was in Beth's case. There were many circumstances which
were recalled by the taste of the food she had been eating at the time
they occurred. The children often dined in the garden in those early
days, and once a piece of apple-dumpling Beth was eating slid off her
plate on to the gravelled walk. Some one picked it up, and put it on her
plate again, all covered with stones and grit, and the sight of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> hot
apple-dumpling made her think of gravel ever afterwards, and filled her
with disgust; so that she could not eat it. She had a great aversion to
bread and butter too for a long time, but that she got over. It would
have been too great an inconvenience to have a child dislike its staple
food, and in all probability she was forced to conquer her aversion, and
afterwards she grew to like bread and butter; but still, if by any
chance the circumstances which caused her dislike to it recurred to her
when she was eating a piece, she was obliged to stop. The incident which
set up the association happened one evening when her father and mother
were out. Beth was alone in the dining-room eating bread and butter, and
Towie, the cat, came into the room with a mouse in her mouth. The mouse
was alive, and Towie let it run a little way, and then pounced down upon
it, then gave it a pat to make it run again. Beth, lying on her stomach
on the floor, watching these proceedings, naturally also became a cat
with a mouse. At last Towie began to eat her mouse, beginning with its
head, which it crushed. Beth, eating her bread and butter in imitation,
saw the white brains, but felt no disgust at the moment. The next time
she had bread and butter, however, she thought of the mouse's brains and
felt sick; and always afterwards the same association of ideas was
liable to recur to her with the same result.</p>

<p>But even the description of anything horrifying affected her in this
way. One day when she was growing up her mother told her at dinner that
she had been on the pier that morning and had seen the body of a man,
all discoloured and swollen from being in the water a long time, towed
into the harbour by a fishing boat. Beth listened and asked questions,
as she always did on these occasions, with the deepest interest. She was
taking soup strongly flavoured with catsup at the moment, and the story
in no way interfered with her appetite; but the next time she tried
catsup, and ever afterwards, she perceived that swollen, discoloured
corpse, and immediately felt nauseated. It is curious that all these
associations of ideas are disagreeable. She had not a single pleasant
one in connection with food.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span>
 of Beth that was not eyes at this time was ears, and her brain was
as busy as a squirrel in the autumn, storing observations and
registering impressions. It does not do to trust to a child's not
understanding. It may not understand at the moment, but it will remember
all the same&mdash;all the more, perhaps, because it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> does not understand;
and its curiosity will help it to solve the problem. Beth did humorous
things at this time, but she had no sense of humour; she was merely
experimenting. Her big eyes looked out of an impassive face solemnly; no
one suspected the phenomenal receptivity which that stolid mask
concealed, and, because the alphabet did not interest her, they formed a
poor opinion of her intellect. The truth was that she had no use for
letters or figures. The books of nature and of life were spread out
before her, and she was conning their contents to more purpose than any
one else could have interpreted them to her in those days. And as to
arithmetic, as soon as her father began to allow her a penny a week for
pocket-money, she discovered that there were two half-pennies in it,
which was all she required to know. She also mastered the system of
debit and credit, for, when she found herself in receipt of a regular
income, and had conquered the first awe of entering a shop and asking
for things, she ran into debt. She received the penny on Saturday, and
promptly spent it in sweets, but by Monday she wanted more, and the
craving was so imperative, that when Miss Deeble sent her down to the
empty kitchen in the afternoon, she could not blow black-beetles with
any enthusiasm, and began to look about for something else to interest
her. It being summer, the window was open, but it was rather out of her
reach. She managed, however, with the help of her stool, to climb on to
the sill, and there, in front of her, was the sea, and down below was
the street&mdash;a goodish drop below if she had stopped to think of it; but
Beth dropped first and thought afterwards, only realising the height
when she had come down plump, and looked up again to see what had
happened to her, surprised at the thud which had jarred her stomach and
made her feet sting. She picked herself up at once, however, and limped
away, not heeding the hurt much, so delightful was it to be out alone
without her hat. By the time she got to Mary Lynch's she was Jane
Nettles going on an errand, an assumption which enabled her to enter the
shop at her ease.</p>

<p>"Good-day," she began. "Give me a ha'porth of pear-drops, and a ha'porth
of raspberry-drops, Mary Lynch, please. I'll pay you on Saturday."</p>

<p>"What are you doing out alone without your hat?" Mary Lynch rejoined,
beaming upon her. "I'm afraid you're a naughty little body."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," Beth answered. "It's my own money." Mary Lynch laughed,
and helped her liberally, adding some cherries to the sweets; and, to
Beth's credit be it stated, the money was duly paid, and without regret,
she being her mother at the moment, looking much relieved to be able to
settle the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
 debt, which shows that, even by this time, Beth had somehow
become aware of money-troubles, and also that she learned to read a
countenance long before she learned to read a book.</p>

<p>She straggled home with the sweets in her hand, but did not eat them,
for now she was a lady going to give a party, and must await the arrival
of her guests. She did not go in by the front door for obvious reasons,
but up the entry down which the open wooden gutter-spout ran, at a
convenient height, from the house into the street. The wash-house was
covered with delicious white roses, which scented the summer afternoon.
Beth concealed her sweets in the rose-tree, and then leant against the
wall and buried her nose in one of the flowers, loving it. The maids
were in the wash-house; she heard them talking; it was all about what he
said and she said. Presently a torrent of dirty water came pouring down
the spout, mingling its disagreeable soapy smell with that of the
flowers. Beth plucked some petals from the rose she was smelling, set
them on the soapy water, and ran down the passage beside them, until
they disappeared in the drain in the street. This delight over, she
wandered into the garden. She was always on excellent terms with all
animals, and was treated by them with singular confidence. Towie, the
cat, had been missing for some time, but now, to Beth's great joy, she
suddenly appeared from Beth could not tell where, purring loudly, and
rubbing herself against Beth's bare legs. The sun poured down upon them,
and the sensation of the cat's warm fur above her socks was delicious.
Beth tried to lift her up in her arms, but she wriggled herself out of
them, and began to run backwards and forwards between her and a gap in
the hedge, until Beth understood that she wished her to follow her
through it into the next garden. Beth did so, and the cat led her to a
little warm nest where, to Beth's wild delight, she showed her a tiny
black kitten. Beth picked it up, and carried it, followed by the cat,
into the house in a state of breathless excitement, shrieking out the
news as she ran. Beth was immediately seized upon. What was she doing at
home when she ought to have been at school? and without her hat, too!
Beth had no explanation to offer, and was hustled off to the nursery,
and there shut up for the rest of the day. She stood in the window most
of the time, a captive princess in the witch's palace, waiting for the
fairy-prince to release her, and catching flies.</p>

<p>The sky became overcast, and a big gun was fired. Beth's father had
something to do with the firing of big guns, and she connected this with
the gathering gloom, stories of God striking wicked people down with
thunder and lightning for their sins, and her own naughtiness, and felt
considerably awed. Presently a little boy was carried down the street on
a bed. His face

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
 looked yellow against the sheets. He was lying flat on
his back, and had a little black cap on, which was right out of doors,
but wrong in bed. He smiled up at Beth as they carried him under the
window, and she stretched out her arms to him with infinite pity. She
knew he was going to die. They all died, that family, or had something
dreadful happen to them. Jane Nettles said there was a curse upon them,
and Beth never thought of them without a shudder. That boy's sisters
both died, and one had something dreadful happen to her, for they dug
her up again, and when they opened the coffin the corpse was all in a
jelly, and every colour of the rainbow, according to Jane Nettles. Beth
believed she had been present upon the occasion, in a grass-grown
graveyard, by the wall of an old church, beneath which steps led down
into a vault. The stones of the steps were mossy, and the sun was
shining. There was a little group of people standing round, with pale,
set, solemn faces, and presently something was brought up, and they all
pressed forward to look at it. Beth could not see what it was for the
grown-up people, and never knew whether or not the whole picture had
been conjured up by her imagination; but as there was always a
foundation of fact in the impressions of this period of her life, it is
not improbable that she really was present at the exhumation, with the
curious and indefatigable Jane Nettles.</p>

<p>Opposite the nursery window, on the other side of the road, was the
butcher's shop, in front of which the butcher made his shambles. Late in
the evening he brought out a board and set it on trestles, then he
brought a sheep, lifted it up by its legs and put it on its back on the
board, tied its feet, and cut its throat. Beth watched the operation
with grave interest, but no other feeling. She had been accustomed to
see it all her life.</p>

<p>Presently Beth's father and mother went out together, and then Beth
stole downstairs, and out to the wash-house to find the sweets in the
white rose-tree. Mildred and Jim were doing their lessons in the
dining-room, and she burst in upon them with the sweets; but Mildred was
cross, and said:</p>

<p>"Don't make such a noise, Beth, my head aches."</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. Beth knew it by the big black bonnet which
played such a large part in her childish recollections. She had a kind
of sensation of having seen herself in it, bobbing along to church, a
sort of Kate Greenaway child, with a head out of all proportion to the
rest of her body, and feeling singularly satisfied&mdash;a feeling, however,
which was less a recollection than an experience continually renewed,
for a nice gown or bonnet was always a pleasure to her.</p>

<p>In church she sat in a big square pew on one side of the aisle, and on
the other side was another pew exactly like it, in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> which sat a young
lady whom Beth believed to be Miss Augusta Noble in the <i>Fairchild
Family</i>. Augusta Noble was very vain, and got burnt to death for
standing on tiptoe before the fire to look at herself in a new frock in
the mirror on the mantelpiece. Beth thought it a suitable end for her,
and did not pity her at all&mdash;perhaps because she went on coming to
church regularly all the same.</p>

<p>After the service they climbed the Castle Hill; and there was the grey
of stonework against a bright blue sky, and green of grass and trees
against the grey, and mountainous clouds of dazzling white hung over a
molten sea; and because of the beauty of it all, Beth burst into a
passion of tears.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with that child?" her father exclaimed impatiently.
"It's very odd other people can bring up their children properly,
Caroline, but you never seem to be able to manage yours."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you tiresome child?" Mrs. Caldwell
exclaimed, shaking Beth by the arm. Beth only sobbed the more. "Look,"
said her mother, pointing to a small lake left by the sea on the shore
when the tide went out, where the children used to wade knee-deep, or
bathe when it was too rough for them to go into the sea; "look, there's
the pond, that bright round thing over there. And look below, near the
Castle&mdash;that great green mound is the giant's grave. When the giant died
they buried him there, and he was so big, he reached all that length
when they laid him in the ground."</p>

<p>"And when he stood up where did he reach to?" said Beth, interested in a
moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, when he sat here, I should think he could make a footstool of his
own grave, and when he stood up he could look over the Castle."</p>

<p>Beth, with big dilated eyes and wet cheeks, saw him do both, and was
oppressed to tears no more that day by delight and wonder of the
beautiful; but she was always liable to these paroxysms, the outcome of
an intensity of pleasure which was positive pain. So, from the first,
she was keenly susceptible to outdoor influences, and it was now that
her memory was stored with impressions which were afterwards of
inestimable value to her, for she never lived amongst the same kind of
scenery again.</p>

<p>The children had the run of some gentleman's grounds, which they called
The Walks. There were banks of flowers, and sidewalks where the London
pride grew, and water, and great trees with hollows in them where the
water lodged. Beth called these fairy wells, and put her fingers in to
see how deep they were, and there were dead leaves in them; and there,
on a memorable

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
 occasion, she found her first skeleton leaf, and told
Jane Nettles she really didn't know before that there were such things.
Once there was a wasp's nest hanging from a branch, and they met a young
man coming away from it, holding a handkerchief to his face. He stopped
to tell Jane Nettles how he had been stung, and the children wandered
off unheeded to look at the nest. It was all grey and gossamer, like
cobwebs laid in layers. Beth was an Indian scout inspecting it from
behind a neighbouring tree; and then she shelled it with sticks, but did
not wait to see it surrender.</p>

<p>They picked up horse-chestnuts from under the trees, in the season, and
hammered the green rind off with stones for the joy of seeing the
beautiful shining, slippery, dark brown, or piebald, polished fruit
within; and also, when there were wet leaves on the ground, they
gathered walnuts from out of the long tangled grass, and stained their
fingers picking off the covering, which was mealy-green when it burst,
and smelt nice; but the nut itself, when they came to it, was always
surprisingly small. There were horrid mahogany-coloured pieces of liver
put about the walks on sticks sometimes. Jane Nettles said they were to
poison the dogs because they came in and destroyed the flowers. Beth
wondered how it was people could eat liver if it poisoned dogs, and was
careful afterwards not to touch it herself. Most children would have
worried the reason out of their nurse, but Jane Nettles was not amiable,
and Beth could never bring herself to ask a question of any one who was
likely either to snub her for asking, or to jeer at her for not knowing.
There are unsympathetic people who have a way of making children feel
ashamed of their ignorance, and rather than be laughed at, a sensitive
child will pretend to know. Beth was extraordinarily sensitive in this
respect, and so it happened that, in later life, she sometimes found
herself in ignorance of things which less remarkable people had learnt
in their infancy for the asking.</p>

<p>These were certainly days of delight to Beth, but the charm of them was
due less to people than to things&mdash;to some sight or scent of nature, the
smell of new-mown hay from a waggon they had stood aside to let pass in
a narrow lane, a glimpse of a high bank on the other side of the road&mdash;a
high grassy bank, covered and crowned with trees, chiefly chestnuts, on
which the sun shone; hawthorn hedgerows from which they used to pick the
green buds children call bread-and-butter, and eat them; and one
privet-hedge in their own garden, an impenetrable hedge, on the other
side of which, as Beth imagined, all kinds of wonderful things took
place. The flowers of those early days were crocuses, snowdrops, white
roses, a little yellow flower they called ladies' fingers, sea-pinks,
and London pride&mdash;particularly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
 London pride. In the walks Jane Nettles
used to teach her the wonderful rhyme of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"London Bridge is broken down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand, said the little Dee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;London Bridge is broken down,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Fair-Lade-ee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so the rhyme, London pride amongst the rock-work, the ornamental
water, a rustic bridge, shining laurel leaves, mahogany-coloured liver,
warmth, light, and sweet airs all became mingled in one gracious memory.</p>

<p>People, however, as has been already shown, also came into her
consciousness, but with less certainty of pleasing, wherefore she
remembered them less, for it was always her habit to banish a
disagreeable thought if she could. One day she went into the garden with
her spade and an old tin biscuit-box. She put the box on the ground
beside her, with the lid off, and began to dig. By-and-by the kitten
came crooning and sidling up to her, and hopped into the box. Beth
instantly put on the lid, and the kitten was a corpse which must be
buried. She hurriedly dug its grave, put in the box, and covered it up
with earth. Just as she had finished, a gruff voice exclaimed: "What are
ye doing there, ye little divil?" and there was old Krangle the
gardener, looking at her over the hedge. "Dig it up again directly," he
said, and Beth, much startled, dug it up quicker than she had buried it.
The kitten had been but loosely covered, and was not much the worse, but
had got some earth in its eye, which was very sore afterwards. People
wondered what had hurt it, and Beth looked from one to the other and
listened with grave attention to their various suppositions on the
subject. She said nothing, however, and Krangle also held his peace,
which led to a very good understanding between them. Krangle had a
cancer on his lip, and Beth was forbidden to kiss him for fear of
catching it. He had a garden of his own too, and a pig, and little
boiled potatoes in his cottage. The doctor's brother died of cancer, and
Beth supposed he had been naughty and kissed old Krangle, though she
wondered he cared to, as Krangle had a very prickly chin. The doctor
often came to see papa. He used to talk about the Bible, and then the
children were sent out of the room. Once Beth hid under the table to
hear what he said. It was all about God, whom it appeared that he did
not like. He had a knob at the end of his nose, and Beth laughed at it,
in punishment of which, as she used to believe, her own nose developed a
little knob at the end. Her mind was very much exercised about the
doctor and his household. He and his brother and sister used to live
together, but now he lived alone, and on a bed in one of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> the rooms,
according to Jane Nettles, there were furs, and lovely silks, satins,
and laces, all being eaten by moths and destroyed because there was no
one to look after them. It seemed such a pity, but whose were they?
Where was the lady?</p>

<p>Bridget used to come up to the nursery when the children were in bed, to
talk to Jane Nettles, and look out of the window. Those gossips in the
nursery were a great source of disturbance to Beth when she ought to
have been composing herself to sleep. She recollected nothing of the
conversations more corrupting than that ghastly account of how the girl
was exhumed, so it is likely that the servants exercised some discretion
when they dropped their voices to a whisper, as they often did; but
these whispered colloquies made her restless and cross, and brought down
upon her a smart order to go to sleep, to which she used to answer
defiantly, "I will if you'll ask me a riddle." One of the riddles was:
"Between two sticks, between two stones, between two old men's
shin-bones. What's that?" The answer had something to do with a
graveyard, but Beth could not remember what.</p>

<p>She used to suffer a small martyrdom in her little crib on those
evenings from what she called "snuff up her nose," a hot, dry, burning
sensation which must have been caused by a stuffy room, and the feverish
state she tossed herself into when she was kept awake after her regular
hour for sleep. Sometimes she sat up in bed suddenly, and cried aloud.
Then Jane Nettles would push her down again on her pillow roughly, and
threaten to call mamma if she wasn't good directly. Occasionally mamma
heard her, and came up of her own accord, and shook her by the shoulder,
and scolded her. Then Beth would lie still sobbing silently, and
wretched as only a lonely, uncomprehended, and uncomplaining child can
be. No one had the faintest conception of what she suffered. Her
naughtinesses were remembered against her, but her latent tenderness was
never suspected. Once the old Doctor said: "That's a peculiarly
sensitive, high-strung, nervous child; you must be gentle with her," and
both parents had stared at him. They were matter-of-fact creatures
themselves, comparatively speaking, with a notion that such nonsense as
nervousness should be shaken out of a child.</p>

<p>At dinner, one day, Beth saw little creatures crawling in a piece of
cheese she had on her plate, and uttered an exclamation of disgust.</p>

<p>"Those are only mites, you silly child," her father said, and then to
her horror, he took up the piece, and ate it. "Do look at that child,
Caroline!" he exclaimed, "she's turned quite pale."</p>

<p>Beth puzzled her head for long afterwards to know what it meant to turn
pale.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Little seeds of superstition were sown in her mind at this time, and
afterwards flourished. She found a wedding-ring in her first piece of
Christmas cake, and was told she would be the first of the party to
marry, which made her feel very important.</p>

<p>Being so sensitive herself, she was morbidly careful of the feelings of
others, and committed sins of insincerity without compunction in her
efforts to spare them. She and Mildred were waiting ready dressed one
day to go and pay a call with mamma. Beth had her big bonnet on, and was
happy; and Mildred also was in a high state of delight. She said Beth's
breath smelt of strawberries, and wanted to know what her own smelt of.</p>

<p>"Raspberries," Beth answered instantly. It was not true, but Beth felt
that something of the kind was expected of her, and so responded
sympathetically. When they got to the house, they were shown into an
immense room, and wandered about it. Beth upset some cushions, and had
awful qualms, expecting every moment to be pounced upon, and shaken; but
she forgot her fright on approaching her hostess, and discovering to her
great surprise that she was busy doing black monkeys on a grey ground in
woolwork. She was astonished to find that it was possible to do such
wonderful work, and she wanted to be taught immediately; but her mother
made her ashamed of herself for supposing that <i>she</i> could do it, silly
little body. They stayed dinner, and Beth cried with rage because the
servant poured white sauce over her fish, and without asking her too.
The fish was an island, and Beth was the hungry sea, devouring it bit by
bit. Of course if you put white sauce over it, you converted it into a
table with a white cloth on, or something of that kind, which you could
not eat, so the fish was spoilt. She got into a difficulty, too, about
Miss Deeble's drawing-room, which was upstairs, overlooking the bay, and
you could only see the water from the window, so there were
water-colours on the wall. Her mother smilingly tried to explain, but
Beth stamped, and stuck to her point; the water accounted for the
water-colours.</p>

<p>On the way home, Beth found a new interest in life. The mill had been
burnt down, and they went to see the smouldering embers, and Beth smelt
fire for the first time. The miller's family had been burnt out, and
were sheltering in a shed. One little boy had his fingers all crumpled
up from the fire. Beth's benevolence awoke. She was all sympathetic
excitement, and wanted to do something for somebody. The miller's wife
was lying on a mattress on the floor. She had a little baby, a new one,
a pudgy red-looking thing. Mrs. Caldwell fed the other children with
bread-and-milk, and Beth offered to teach them their letters.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell laughed at her: "<i>You</i> teach them their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> letters!" she
exclaimed. "You had better learn your own properly." And Mildred also
jeered. Beth subsided, crimson with shame at being thus lowered in
everybody's estimation. She was deficient in self-esteem, and required
to be encouraged. Praise merely gave her confidence; but her mother
never would praise her. She brought all her children up on the same
plan, regardless of their different dispositions. It made Mildred vain
to praise her, and therefore Beth must not be praised; and so her mother
checked her mental growth again and again instead of helping her to
develop it. "It's no use your trying to do that, Beth, you can't," she
would say, when Beth would have done it easily, if only she had been
assured that she could.</p>

<p>Beth had a strange dream that night after the fire, which made a lasting
impression upon her. Dorman's Isle was a green expanse, flat as a table,
and covered with the short grass that grows by the sea. At high tide it
was surrounded by water, but when the tide was low, it rested on great
grey, rugged rocks, as the lid of a box rests upon its sides. Between
the grey of the rocks and the green of the grass there was a fringe of
sea-pinks. That night she dreamt that she was under Dorman's Isle, and
it was a great bare cave, not very high, and lighted by torches which
people held in their hands. There were a number of people, and they were
all members of her own family, ancestors in the dresses of their day,
distant relations&mdash;numbers of strange people whom she had never heard
of; as well as her own father and mother, brothers and sisters. She knew
she was under Dorman's Isle, but she knew also that it was the dark
space beneath the stage of a theatre. When she entered, the rest of the
family were already assembled; but they none of them spoke to each
other, and the doors kept opening and shutting, and the people seemed to
melt away, until at last only three or four remained, and they were just
going. She saw the shine on the paint of the door-posts, and the smoke
of the torches, as they let themselves out. Then they had all gone, and
left her alone in a cave full of smoke. Vainly she struggled to follow
them, the doors were fast, the smoke was smothering her, and in the
agony of a last effort to escape she awoke.</p>

<p>In after days, when Beth began to think, she used to wonder how it was
she knew those people were her ancestors, and that the place was like
any part of a theatre. She had never heard either of ancestors or
theatres at that time. Was it recollection? Or is there some more
perfect power to know than the intellect&mdash;a power lying latent in the
whole race, which will eventually come into possession of it; but with
which, at present, only some few rare beings are perfectly endowed. Beth
had the sensation of having been nearer to something in her infancy than
she ever was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
 again&mdash;nearer to knowing what it is the trees
whisper&mdash;what the murmur means, the all-pervading murmur which sounds
incessantly when everything is hushed, as at night; nearer to the
"arcane" of that evening on the Castle Hill when she first felt her
kinship with nature, and burst into song. It may have been hereditary
memory, a knowledge of things transmitted to her by her ancestors along
with their features, virtues, and vices; but, at any rate, she herself
was sure that she possessed a power of some kind in her infancy which
gradually lapsed as her intellectual faculties developed. She was
conscious that the senses had come between her and some mysterious joy
which was not of the senses, but of the spirit. There lingered what
seemed to be the recollection of a condition anterior to this, a
condition of which no tongue can tell, which is not to be put into
words, or made evident to those who have no recollection; but which some
will comprehend by the mere allusion to it. All her life long Beth
preserved a half consciousness of this something&mdash;something which eluded
her&mdash;something from which she gradually drifted further away as she grew
older&mdash;some sort of vision which opened up fresh tracts to her; but
whether of country, or whether of thought, she could not say. Only, when
it came to her, all was immeasurable about her; and she was above&mdash;above
in a great calm through which she moved without any sort of effort that
is known to us; she just thought it, and was there; while humanity
dwindled away into insignificance below.</p>

<p>One other strange vision she had which she never forgot. With her
intellect, she believed it to have been a dream, but her further faculty
always insisted that it was a recollection. She was with a large company
in an indescribable, hollow space, bare of all furnishments because none
were required; and into this space there came a great commotion, bright
light and smoke, without heat or sense of suffocation. Then she was
alone, making for an aperture; struggling and striving with pain of
spirit to gain it; and when she had found it, she shot through, and
awoke in the world. She awoke with a terrible sense of desolation upon
her, and with the consciousness of having traversed infinite space at
infinite speed in an interval of time which her mortal mind could not
measure.</p>

<p>All through life, when she was in possession of her further faculty, and
perceived by that means&mdash;which was only at fitful intervals, doubtless
because of unfavourable circumstances and surroundings&mdash;she was calm,
strong, and confident. She looked upon life as from a height, viewing it
both in detail and as a whole. But when she had only her intellect to
rely upon, all was uncertain, and she became weak, vacillating, and
dependent. So that she appeared to be a singular mixture of weakness
and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
 strength, courage and cowardice, faith and distrust; and just what
she would do depended very much on what was expected of her, or what
influence she was under, and also on some sudden impulse which no one,
herself included, could have anticipated.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> to this time, Beth's reminiscences jerk along from incident to
incident, but now there come the order and sequence of an eventful
period, perfectly recollected. The date is fixed by a change of
residence. Her father, who was a commander in the coastguard, was
transferred on promotion from the north of Ireland to another
appointment in the wild west, and Beth was just entering upon her
seventh year when they moved. Captain Caldwell went on in advance to
take up his appointment, and Jim accompanied him; Mildred, Beth, and
Bernadine, the youngest, who had arrived two years after Beth, being
left to follow with their mother. The elder children had been sent to
England to be educated. In their father's absence Mildred and Bernadine
were transferred to their mother's room, Jane Nettles and Bridget, the
sulky, had disappeared, and Kitty slept in the nursery with Beth. Beth
had grown too long for her crib, but still had to sleep in it, and her
legs were cramped at night and often ached because she could not stretch
them out, and the pain kept her awake.</p>

<p>"Mamma, my legs do ache in bed," she said one day.</p>

<p>"Beth, you really <i>are</i> a whiny child, you always have a grievance," her
mother complained.</p>

<p>"But, mamma, they <i>do</i> ache."</p>

<p>"Well, it's only growing pains," Mrs. Caldwell replied with a satisfied
air, as if to name the trouble were to ease it. And so Beth's legs ached
on unrelieved, and, when they kept her awake, Kitty became the object of
her contemplation. The sides of the crib were like the seat of a
cane-bottomed chair, and Beth had enlarged one of the holes by fidgeting
at it with her fingers. This was her look-out station. A night-light had
been conceded to her nervousness at the instance of Dr. Gottley, when it
became a regular thing for her to wake in the dark out of one of her
vivid dreams, and shriek because she could not see where she was. The
usual beating and shaking had been tried to cure her of her nonsense,
but this sensible treatment only seemed to make her worse, she was such
a tiresome child, till at last, when Dr. Gottley threatened serious
consequences, the light was allowed, a dim little float that burned on
an inch of oil in a glass of water,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
 and made Kitty look so funny when
she came up to bed. Kitty began to undress, and at the same time to
mutter her prayers, as soon as she got into the room; and sometimes she
would go down on her knees and beat her breast, and sigh and groan to
the Blessed Virgin, beseeching her to help her. Beth thought at first
she was in great distress, and pitied her, but after a time she believed
that Kitty was enjoying herself, perhaps because she also had begun to
enjoy these exercises. Beth had been taught to say her Protestant
prayers, but not made to feel that she was addressing them to any
particular personality that appealed to her imagination, as Kitty's
Blessed Lady did.</p>

<p>"Kitty, Kitty," she cried one night, sitting up in her crib, with a
great dry sob. "Tell <i>me</i> how to do it. I want to speak to her too."</p>

<p>Kitty, who was on her knees on the floor, with her rosary clasped in her
hands, her arms and shoulders bare, and her dark hair hanging down her
back, looked up, considerably startled: "Holy Mother! how you frightened
me!" she exclaimed. "Go to sleep."</p>

<p>"But I <i>want</i> to speak to her," Beth persisted.</p>

<p>"Arrah, be good now, Miss Beth," Kitty coaxed, still on her knees.</p>

<p>"I'll be good if you'll tell me what to say," Beth bargained.</p>

<p>Kitty rose from her knees, went to the side of the crib, and looked down
at the child.</p>

<p>"What do ye want to say to her at all?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Beth answered. "I just want to speak to her. I just want
to say, 'Holy Mother, come close, I love you. Stay by me all night long,
and when the daylight comes don't forget me.' How would you say that,
Kitty?"</p>

<p>"Bless your purty eyes, darlint!" said Kitty, "just say it that way
every time. It couldn't be better said, not by the praste himself. An'
if the Blessed Mother ever hears anything from this world," she added in
an undertone, "she'll hear that. But turn over now, an' go to sleep,
honey. See! I'll stand here till ye do, and sing to you!"</p>

<p>Beth turned over on her left side with her face to the wall, and settled
herself to sleep contentedly, while Kitty stood beside her, patting her
shoulder gently, and crooning in a low sweet voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look down, O Mother Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From thy bright throne above;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Send down upon thy children<br /></span>
<span class="i3">One holy glance of love!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And if a heart so tender<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With pity flows not o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then turn, O Mother Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And smile on me no more."<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></div></div>

<p>As Beth listened her little heart expanded, and presently the Blessed
Virgin stood beside her bed, a heavenly vision, like Kitty, with dark
hair growing low on her forehead and hanging down her back, blue eyes,
and an earnest, guileless face. Beth's little mouth, drooping with
dissatisfaction ordinarily, curled up at the corners, and so, thoroughly
tranquillised, she fell happily asleep, with a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>Kitty bent low to look at her, and shook her head several times.
"Coaxin's better nor bating you, anyway," she muttered. "But what are
they going to do wid ye at all?" She stood up, and raised her clasped
hands. "Holy Mother, it 'ud be well maybe if ye'd take her to
yourself&mdash;just now&mdash;God forgive me for saying it."</p>

<p>Next morning Mrs. Caldwell was sitting at breakfast with Beth and
Mildred. Every moment she glanced at the window, and at last the postman
passed. She listened, but there was no knock, and her heart sank.</p>

<p>"Beth, will you stop drumming with your spoon?" she exclaimed irritably.
As she spoke, however, Kitty came in with the expected letter in her
hand, and Mrs. Caldwell's countenance cleared: "I thought the postman
had passed," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, m'em," Kitty rejoined. "I was standin' at the door, an' he gave me
the letter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell had opened it by this time, but it was very short. "How
often am I to tell you not to stand at the door, letting in the cold
air, Kitty?" she snapped.</p>

<p>"And how'd I sweep the steps, m'em, if you plase, when I'm not to stand
at the door?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Caldwell was reading the letter, and again her countenance
cleared. "Papa wants us to go to him as soon as ever we can get ready!"
was her joyful exclamation. "And, oh, they've had such snow! See,
Mildred, here's a sketch of the chapel nearly buried."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see, too," Beth cried, running round the table to look over
Mildred's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Did papa draw that? How <i>wonderful</i>!"</p>

<p>"Beth, don't lean on me so," Mildred said crossly, shaking her off.</p>

<p>The sketch, which was done in ink on half a sheet of paper, showed a
little chapel with great billows of snow rolling along the sides and up
to the roof. After breakfast, Mildred sat down and began to copy it in
pencil, to Beth's intense surprise. The possibility of copying it
herself would never have occurred to her, but when she saw Mildred doing
it of course she must try too. She could make nothing of it, however,
till Mildred showed her how to place each stroke, and then she was very
soon weary

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
 of the effort, and gave it up, yawning. Drawing was not to
be one of her accomplishments.</p>

<p>Kitty was to accompany them to the west.</p>

<p>When the day of departure arrived, a great coach and pair came to the
door, and the luggage was piled up on it. Beth, with her mouth set, and
her eyes twice their normal size from excitement, was everywhere,
watching everybody, afraid to miss anything that happened. Her mother's
movements were a source of special interest to her. At the last moment
Mrs. Caldwell slipped away alone to take leave of the place which had
been the first home of her married life. She was a young girl when she
came to it, the daughter of a country gentleman, accustomed to luxury,
but right ready to enjoy poverty with the man of her heart; and poverty
enough she had had to endure, and sickness and sorrow too&mdash;troubles
inevitable&mdash;besides some of those other troubles, which are the harder
to bear because they are not inevitable. But still, she had had her
compensations, and it was of these she thought as she took her last
leave of the little place. She went to the end of the garden first,
closely followed by Beth, and looked through the thin hedge out across
the field. She seemed to be seeing things which were farther away than
Beth's eyes could reach. Then she went to an old garden seat, touched it
tenderly, and stood looking down at it for some seconds. Many a summer
evening she had sat there at work while her husband read to her. It was
early spring, and the snowdrops and crocuses were out. She gathered a
little bunch of them. When she had made the tour of the garden, she
returned to the house, and went into every room, Beth following her
faithfully, at a safe distance. In the nursery she stood some little
time looking round at the bare walls, and seeming to listen expectantly.
No doubt she heard ghostly echoes of the patter of children's feet, the
ring of children's voices. As she turned to go she pressed her
handkerchief to her eyes. In her own room she lingered still longer,
going from one piece of furniture to another, and laying her hand on
each. It was handsome furniture, such as a lady should have about her,
and every piece represented a longer or shorter period of self-denial,
both on her own part and on her husband's, and a proportionately keen
joy in the acquisition of it. She remembered so well when the wardrobe
came home, and the dressing-table too, and the mahogany drawers. The
furniture was to follow to the new home, and each piece would still have
its own history, but, once it was moved from its accustomed place, new
associations would have to be formed, and that was what she dreaded. She
could picture the old home deserted, and herself yearning for it, and
for the old days; but she could not imagine a new home or a new

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> chapter
of life with any great interest or pleasure in it, anything, in fact,
but anxiety.</p>

<p>When at last she left the house, she was quite overcome to find that a
little crowd of friends of every degree had collected to wish her good
speed. She went from one to the other, shaking hands, and answering
their words in kindly wise. Mary Lynch gave Beth a currant-cake, and
lifted her into the coach, though she could quite well have got in by
herself. Then they were off, and Mrs. Caldwell stood at the door, wiping
her eyes, and gazing at the little house till they turned the corner of
the street, and lost sight of it for ever.</p>

<p>The tide was out, Dorman's green Isle rested on its grey rocks, the pond
shone like a mirror on the shore, and the young grass was springing on
the giant's grave; but the branches were still bare and brown on the
Castle Hill, and the old grey castle stood out whitened by contrast with
a background of dark and lowering sky. Beth's highly-strung nerves,
already overstrained by excitement, broke down completely under the
oppression of those heavy clouds, and she became convulsed with sobs.
Kitty took her on her knee, but tried in vain to soothe her before the
currant-cake and the motion of the coach had made her deadly sick, after
which she dozed off from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was a nightmare of nausea to her. She was
constantly being lifted out of the carriage, and made to lie on a sofa
somewhere while the horses were being changed, or put to bed for the
night, and dragged up again unrefreshed in the early morning, and
consigned once more to misery. Sometimes great dark mountains towered
above her, filling her with dread; and sometimes a long lonely level of
bare brown bogs was all about her, overwhelming her little soul with
such a terrible sense of desolation that she cowered down beside Kitty,
and clung to her shivering.</p>

<p>Once her mother shook her for something, and Beth turned faint.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with her, Kitty?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed, alarmed by
her white face.</p>

<p>"You've jest shook the life out of her, m'em, I think," Kitty answered
her tranquilly: "An' ye'll not rare her that way, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell began to dislike Kitty.</p>

<p>On the third day they drove down a delightful road, with hedges on
either hand, footpaths, and trees, among which big country-houses
nestled. The mountains were still in the neighbourhood, but not near
enough to be awesome. On one side of the road was a broad shallow
stream, so clear you could see the brown stones at the bottom, a
salmon-stream with weirs and waterfalls.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>They were nearing a town, and Kitty began to put the things together.
Beth became interested. Mamma looked out of the window every instant,
and at last she exclaimed in a tone of relief, which somehow belied the
words: "Here's papa! I <i>knew</i> he would come!" And there was a horse at
the window, and papa was on the horse, looking in at them. Mamma's face
became quite rosy, and she laughed a good deal and showed her teeth.
Beth had not noticed them before.</p>

<p>"What are you staring at, Beth?" Mildred whispered.</p>

<p>"Mamma's all pink," Beth said.</p>

<p>"That's blushing," said Mildred.</p>

<p>"What's blushing?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Getting pink."</p>

<p>"What does she do it for?"</p>

<p>"She can't help it."</p>

<p>Beth continued to stare, and at last Mrs. Caldwell noticed it, and asked
her what she was looking at.</p>

<p>"You've got nice white teeth," said Beth. Mrs. Caldwell smiled.</p>

<p>"Have you only just discovered that?" papa asked through the window.</p>

<p>"You never told me," Beth protested, thinking herself reproached. "You
said Jane Nettles had."</p>

<p>The smile froze on mamma's lips, and papa's horse became unmanageable.
Beth saw there was something wrong, and stopped, looking from one to the
other intently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell recovered herself. "What a stolid face she has!" she
remarked presently by way of breaking an awkward pause.</p>

<p>Beth wondered what "stolid" meant, and who "she" was.</p>

<p>"She doesn't look well," papa observed.</p>

<p>"She's jest had the life shook out of her, sir," Kitty put in.</p>

<p>"Kitty, how dare you?" Mrs. Caldwell began.</p>

<p>"It's to the journey I'm alludin' now, m'em," Kitty explained with
dignity. "The child can't bear the travellin'."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't last much longer now," said papa, and then made some
remark to mamma in Italian, which brought back her good-humour. They
always spoke Italian to each other, because papa did not know French so
well as mamma did. Beth supposed at that time that all grown-up people
spoke French or Italian to each other, and she used to wonder which she
would speak when she was grown up.</p>

<p>They stopped at an inn for an hour or two, for there was still another
stage of this interminable journey. Mildred had a bag with a big doll in
it, and some almond-sweets. She left it on a window-seat when they went
to have something to eat, and when she thought of it again it was
nowhere to be found.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"They would steal the teeth out of your head in this God-forsaken
country," Captain Caldwell exclaimed, in a tone of exasperation.</p>

<p>An awful vision of igneous rocks, with mis-shapen creatures prowling
about amongst them, instantly appeared to Beth in illustration of a
God-forsaken country, but she tried vainly to imagine how stealing teeth
out of your head was to be managed.</p>

<p>When they set off again, and had left the grey town with its green trees
and clear rivulet behind, the road lay through a wild and desolate
region. Great dark mountains rolled away in every direction, and were
piled up above the travellers to the very sky. The scene was most
melancholy in its grandeur, and Beth, gazing at it fascinated, with big
eyes dilated to their full extent, became exceedingly depressed. At one
turn of the way, in a field below, they saw a gentleman carrying a gun,
and attended by a party of armed policemen.</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Burke going over his property," Captain Caldwell observed to
his wife. "He's unpopular just now, and daren't move without an escort.
His life's not worth a moment's purchase a hundred yards from his own
gate, and I expect he'll be shot like a dog some day, with all his
precautions."</p>

<p>"Oh, why does he stay?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Just pluck," her husband answered; "and he likes it. It certainly does
add to the interest of life."</p>

<p>"O Henry! don't speak like that," Mrs. Caldwell remonstrated. "They
can't owe you any grudge."</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell flipped a fly from his horse's ear.</p>

<p>Beth gazed down at the doomed gentleman, and fairly quailed for him. She
half expected to see the policemen turn on him and shoot him before her
eyes, and a strange excitement gradually grew upon her. She seemed to be
seeing and hearing and feeling without eyes, or ears, or a body.</p>

<p>The carriage rocked like a ship at sea, and once or twice it seemed to
be going right over.</p>

<p>"What a dreadfully bad road!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," her husband rejoined, "the roads about here are the very devil.
This is one of the best. Do you see that one over there?" pointing with
his whip to a white line that zigzagged across a neighbouring mountain.
"It's disused now. That's Gallows Hill, where a man was hanged."</p>

<p>Beth gazed at the spot with horror. "I see him!" she cried.</p>

<p>"See whom?" said her mother.</p>

<p>"I see the man hanging."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed. "Why, the man was hanged ages
ago. He isn't there now."</p>

<p>"You must speak the truth, young lady," papa said severely.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth, put to shame by the reproof, shrank into herself. She was keenly
sensitive to blame. But all the same her great grey eyes were riveted on
the top of the hill, for there, against the sky, she did distinctly see
the man dangling from the gibbet.</p>

<p>"Kitty," she whispered, "don't you see him?"</p>

<p>"Whisht, darlint," Kitty said, covering Beth's eyes with her hand. "I
don't see him. But I'll not be after calling ye a liar because ye do,
for I guess ye see more nor most, Holy Mother purtect us! But whisht
now, you mustn't look at him any more."</p>

<p>The carriage came to the brow of the mountain, and down below was their
destination, Castletownrock, a mere village, consisting principally of
one long, steep street. Some distance below the village again, the great
green waves of a tempestuous sea broke on a dangerous coast.</p>

<p>"The two races don't fuse," papa was saying to mamma, "in this part of
the country, at all events. There's an Irish and an English side to the
street. The English side has a flagged footpath, and the houses are neat
and clean, and well-to-do; on the Irish side all is poverty and dirt and
confusion."</p>

<p>Just outside the village, a little group of people waited to welcome
them&mdash;Mr. Macbean the rector, Captain Keene, the three Misses Keene, and
Jim.</p>

<p>The carriage was stopped, and they all got out and walked the rest of
the distance to the inn, where they were to stay till the furniture
arrived. On the way down the street they saw their new home. It made no
impression on Beth. But she recognised the Roman Catholic Chapel on the
other side of the road from papa's drawing, only it looked different
because there was no snow.</p>

<p>The "gentleman and lady" who kept the inn, Mr. and Mrs. Mayne, with
their two daughters, met them at the door, and shook hands with mamma,
and kissed the children.</p>

<p>Then they went into the inn parlour, and there was wine and plum-cake,
and Dr. and Mrs. Macdougall came with their little girl Lucy, who was
eleven years old, Mildred's age.</p>

<p>Mr. Macbean, the rector, who was tall and thin, and had a brown beard
that waggled when he talked, drew Beth to his side, and began to ask her
questions, just when she wanted so much to hear what everybody else was
saying, too.</p>

<p>"Well, and what have you been taught?" he began.</p>

<p>Beth gazed at him blankly.</p>

<p>"Do you love God?" he proceeded, putting his hand on her head.</p>

<p>Beth looked round the room, perplexed, then fixed her eyes on his beard,
and watched it waggle with interest.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ask her if she knows anything about the other gentleman," Captain Keene
put in jocosely&mdash;"here's to his health!" and he emptied his glass.</p>

<p>Beth's great eyes settled upon him with sudden fixity.</p>

<p>"I suppose you never heard of the devil?" he proceeded.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I have," was Beth's instant and unexpected rejoinder. "The
devil is a bad road."</p>

<p>There was an explosion of laughter at this.</p>

<p>"But you said so, papa," Beth remonstrated indignantly.</p>

<p>"My dear child, I said just the reverse."</p>

<p>"What's the reverse?" said Beth, picturing another personality.</p>

<p>"There now, that will do," Mrs. Caldwell interposed. "Little bodies must
be seen and not heard."</p>

<p>Mr. Macbean stroked Beth's head&mdash;"There is something in here, I expect,"
he observed.</p>

<p>"Not much, I'm afraid," Mrs. Caldwell answered. "We've hardly been able
to teach her anything."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Mr. Macbean ejaculated, reflecting on the specimen he had heard of
the method pursued. "You must let me see what <i>I</i> can do."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a few days all the bustle of getting into the new house began. The
furniture arrived in irregular batches. Some of it came and some of it
did not come. When a box was opened there was nothing that was wanted in
it, only things that did not go together, and mamma was worried, and
papa was cross.</p>

<p>The workpeople were wild and ignorant, and only trustworthy as long as
they were watched. They were unaccustomed to the most ordinary comforts
of civilised life, particularly in the way of furniture. When the family
arrived at the house one morning, they found Mrs. Caldwell's wardrobe,
mahogany drawers, and other articles of bedroom furniture, set up in
conspicuous positions in the sitting-room, and the carpenter was much
ruffled when he was ordered to take them upstairs.</p>

<p>"Shure it's mad they are," he remonstrated to one of the servants, "to
have sich foine things put in a bedroom where nobody'll see thim."</p>

<p>The men came up from the coastguard station to scrape the walls, and
Ellis, the petty officer, used the bread-knife, and broke it, and papa
bawled at him. Beth was sorry for Ellis.</p>

<p>The house was built of stone, and very damp. There was a great deal of
space in it, but little accommodation. On the ground-floor were a huge
hall, kitchen, pantry and sitting-room,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
 all flagged. The sitting-room
was the only one in the house, and had to be used as dining-room and
drawing-room, but it was large enough for that and to spare. There was a
big yard and a big garden too, and Riley was in the stable, and Biddy
and Anne in the kitchen, and Kitty in the nursery. This increase of
establishment, which meant so much to the parents, was accepted as a
matter of course by the children.</p>

<p>Kitty told Riley and Biddy and Anne about what Beth had seen on Gallows
Hill, and they often asked Beth what she saw when she used to sit
looking at nothing. Then Beth would think things, and describe them,
because it seemed to please the servants. They used to be very serious,
and shake their heads and cross themselves, with muttered ejaculations,
but all the time they liked it. This encouraged Beth, and she used to
think and think of things to tell them.</p>

<p>Beth was exceedingly busy in her own way at this time. Her mind was
being rapidly stored with impressions, and nothing escaped her.</p>

<p>The four children and Kitty were put all together in one great nursery,
an arrangement of which Kitty, with the fastidious delicacy of a strict
Catholic, did not at all approve.</p>

<p>"Indeed, m'em," she said, "I'm thinkin' Master Jim's too sharp to be in
the nursery wid his sisters now."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Kitty," Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed. "How can you be so
evil-minded? Master Jim's only a child&mdash;a baby of ten!"</p>

<p>"Och, thin, me'm, it's an ould-fashioned baby he is," said Kitty; "and
I'm thinkin' it's a bit of a screen or a curtain I'd like for dressin'
behind if he's to be wid us."</p>

<p>"I have nothing of the kind to give you," Mrs. Caldwell rejoined. And
afterwards she made merry with papa about Kitty's prudishness.</p>

<p>But Kitty was right as it happened. Jim had been left pretty much to his
own devices during the time he had been alone with his father at
Castletownrock. Captain Caldwell's theory was that boys would look after
themselves, "and the sooner you let 'em the sooner you'd make men of
'em. Blood will tell, sir. Your gentleman's son is a match for any
ragamuffin"&mdash;a theory which Jim justified in many a free fight; but,
during the suspension of hostilities he hobnobbed with the ragamuffins,
who took a terrible revenge, for by the time Mrs. Caldwell arrived Jim
was thoroughly corrupted. Kitty took precautions, however. She arranged
the nursery-life so that Master Jim did not associate with his sisters
more than was absolutely necessary. She had him up in the morning,
bathed, and sent off to school before she disturbed the little girls,
and at night she never left the nursery until he was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> asleep. Out of her
slender purse she bought some print, and fixed up a curtain for his
sisters to dress behind, and all else that she had to do for the
children was done decently and in order. She had almost entire charge of
them, their mother being engrossed with her husband, whose health and
spirits had already begun to suffer from overwork and exposure to the
climate.</p>

<p>Kitty was teaching her charges dainty ways, mentally as well as
physically. When she had washed them at night, she made them purge their
little souls of all the sins of the day in prayer, and in the morning
she taught them how to fortify themselves with good resolutions. Beth
took naturally to the Catholic training, and solemnly dedicated herself
to the Blessed Virgin; Mildred conformed, but without enthusiasm; the
four-year-old baby Bernadine lisped little <i>Aves</i>; but Jim, in the words
of Captain Keene, "the old buffalo," as their father called him, sneered
at that sort of thing "as only fit for women."</p>

<p>"Men drink whisky," said Jim, puffing out his chest.</p>

<p>"True for ye," said Kitty; "but I've been told that them as drinks
whisky here goes dry in the next world."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall drink whisky and kiss the girls all the same," said Jim.
"And I wouldn't be a Catholic now, not to save me sowl. I owe the
Catholics a grudge. They insulted me."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Kitty.</p>

<p>"At the midnight Mass last Christmas. Father John got up, and ordered
all heretics out of the sacred house of God, and Pat Fagan ses to me,
'Are ye a heretic?' and I ses, 'I am, Pat Fagan.' 'Thin out ye go,' ses
he, and, but for that, I'd 'a' bin a Catholic; so see what you lose by
insulting a gentleman."</p>

<p>"What's insulting?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>Jim slapped her face. "That's insulting," he explained.</p>

<p>Beth struck him back promptly, and a scuffle ensued.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's little divils yez are, the lot of ye!" cried Kitty as she
separated them.</p>

<p>During fits of nervous irritability Captain Caldwell had a habit of
pacing about the house for hours at a time. One evening he happened to
be walking up and down on the landing outside the nursery door, which
was a little way open, and his attention was attracted by Beth's voice.
She was reciting a Catholic hymn softly, but with great feeling, as if
every word of it were a pleasure to her.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" he demanded, breaking in on her devotions.
"What papistical abominations have you been teaching the child, Kitty?"</p>

<p>"Shure, sorr, it's jest a bit of a hymn," said Kitty bravely; but her
heart sank, and the colour left her lips.</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell was furious.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Caroline!" he called peremptorily, going to the head of the stairs,
"Caroline, come up directly!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell fussed up in hot haste.</p>

<p>"Do you know," Captain Caldwell demanded, "that this woman is making
idolaters of your children? I heard this child just now praying to the
Virgin Mary! Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell's pale face flushed with anger.</p>

<p>"How dare you do such a thing, you wicked woman?" she exclaimed. "I
shall not keep you another day in the house. Pack up your things at
once, and go the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"O mamma!" Beth cried, "you're not going to send Kitty away? Kitty,
Kitty, you won't go and leave me?"</p>

<p>"There, you see!" Captain Caldwell exclaimed. "You see the influence
she's got over the child already! That's the Jesuit all over!"</p>

<p>"An ignorant woman like you, who can hardly read and write, setting up
to teach <i>my</i> children, indeed&mdash;how dare you?" Mrs. Caldwell stormed.</p>

<p>"Well, m'em, I <i>am</i> an ignorant woman that can hardly read and write,"
Kitty answered with dignity; "but I could tell you some things ye'll not
find out in all yer books, and may be they'd surprise ye."</p>

<p>"Kitty, ye'll not go and leave me," Beth repeated passionately.</p>

<p>"Troth, an' I'd stay for your sake if I could," said Kitty, "fur it's a
bad time I'm afraid ye'll be havin' once I'm gone."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that?" Captain Caldwell exclaimed. "Now you see what comes
of getting people of this kind into the house. She's going to make out
that the child is ill-treated."</p>

<p>"One of <i>my</i> children ill-treated!" Mrs. Caldwell cried scornfully. "Who
would believe her?" Then turning to Beth: "If I ever hear you repeat a
word that wicked woman has taught you, I'll beat you as long as I can
stand over you."</p>

<p>Kitty looked straight into Mrs. Caldwell's face, and smiled
sarcastically, but uttered not a word.</p>

<p>"How dare you stand there, grinning at me in that impertinent way, you
low woman?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed with great exasperation. "I believe
you <i>are</i> a Jesuit, sent here to corrupt my children. But go you shall
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll go, m'em," Kitty answered quietly. She knew the case was
hopeless.</p>

<p>"There, now," said Mrs. Caldwell, turning to her husband. "Do you see?
That shows you! She doesn't care a bit."</p>

<p>Beth was clinging to Kitty, but her mother seized her by the arm, and
flung her half across the room, and was about to follow

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> her, but
Captain Caldwell interfered. "That will do," he said significantly.
"It's no use venting your rage on the child. In future choose your
nurses better."</p>

<p>"Then, in future, give me better advice when I consult you about them,"
Mrs. Caldwell retorted, following him out of the room.</p>

<p>Beth clung to Kitty the whole night long, and had to be torn from her in
the morning, screaming and kicking. She stood in front of her mother,
her eyes and cheeks ablaze:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall pray to the Blessed Virgin&mdash;I shall pray to the Blessed
Virgin&mdash;every <i>hour</i> of my life," she gasped, "and you can't prevent me.
Beat me as long as you can stand over me if you like, but I'll only pray
the harder."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, m'em," Kitty cried, clasping her hands, "let that child
alone. Shure she's a sweet lamb if you'd give her a chance. But ye put
the divil into her wid yer shakin' an' yer batin', and mischief'll come
of it sooner or later, mark my words."</p>

<p>When Kitty had gone, Mrs. Caldwell shut Beth up in the nursery with Baby
Bernadine. Beth threw herself on the floor, and sobbed until she had
exhausted her tears; then she gathered herself together, and sat on the
floor with her hands clasped round her legs, her chin on her knees,
looking up dreamily at the sky, through the nursery window. Her pathetic
little face was all drawn and haggard and hopeless. But presently she
began to sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Ave Maria!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother of the desolate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guide of the unfortunate!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hear from thy starry home our prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If sorrow will await us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyrants vex and hate us,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Teach us thine own most patient part to bear!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Sancta Maria!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we are sighing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we are dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Give to us thine aid of prayer!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As she sang, comfort came to her, and the little voice swelled in
volume.</p>

<p>Baby Bernadine also sat on the floor, opposite to Beth, and gazed at
her, much impressed. When she had finished singing, Beth became aware of
her sister's reverent attention, and put out her tongue at her.
Bernadine laughed. Then Beth crisped up her hands till they looked like
claws, and began to make a variety of hideous faces. Bernadine thought
it was a game and smiled at first, but finally she ceased to recognise
her sister and shrieked

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
 aloud in terror. Beth heard her mother hurrying
up, and got behind the door so that her mother could not see her as she
opened it. Mrs. Caldwell hurried up to the baby&mdash;"The darling, then,
what have they been doing to you?"&mdash;and Beth made her escape. As she
crossed the hall, some one knocked at the front door. Beth opened it a
crack. Captain Keene was outside. When she saw him, she recollected
something she had heard about his religious opinions, and began to
question him eagerly. His answers were apparently exciting, for
presently she flung the door wide open to let him in, then ran to the
foot of the stairs, and shouted at the top of her voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa, papa, come down! come directly! Here's old Keene, the old
Buffalo, and he says there is no God!"</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell descended the stairs hurriedly, but, on catching a
glimpse of his countenance, Beth did not wait to receive him.</p>

<p>She had to pass through the kitchen to get into the yard. It was the
busy time of the day, and Biddy and Anne and Riley, all without shoes or
stockings, were playing football with a bladder.</p>

<p>Biddy tried to detain Beth.</p>

<p>"Arrah, bad luck to ye, Biddy," Beth cried, imitating the brogue. "Let
me go, d'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Holy Mother, preserve us!" Biddy exclaimed, crossing herself. "Don't ye
ever be afther wishin' anybody bad luck, Miss Beth; shure ye'll bring it
if ye do."</p>

<p>"Thin don't ye ever be afther stoppin' me when I want to be going,
Biddy," Beth rejoined, stamping her foot, "or I'll <i>blast</i> ye," she
added as she passed out into the sunlight.</p>

<p>Fowls and ducks and Jim's pet pigeons were the only creatures moving in
the yard. Beth stood among them, watching them for a little, then went
to the cornbin in the stable, and got some oats. There was a shallow tub
of water for the birds to drink; Beth hunkered down beside it, and held
out her hand, full of corn. The pigeons were very tame, and presently a
beautiful blue-rock came up confidently, and began to eat. His eyes were
a deep rich orange colour. Beth caught him, and stroked his glossy
plumage, delighting in the exquisite metallic sheen on his neck and
breast. The colour gave her an almost painful sensation of pleasure,
which changed on a sudden into a fit of blind exasperation. Her grief
for the loss of Kitty had gripped her again with a horrid twinge. She
clenched her teeth in her pain, her fingers closed convulsively round
the pigeon's throat, and she held him out at arm's length, and shook him
viciously till the nictitating membrane dropped over his eyes, his head
sank back, his bill opened, and he hung

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
 from her hand, an inert heap of
ruffled feathers. Then the tension of her nerves relaxed; it was a
relief to have crushed the life out of something. She let the bird drop,
and stood looking at him, as an animal might have looked, with an
impassive face which betrays no shade of emotion. As she did so,
however, the bird showed signs of life; and, suddenly, quickening into
interest, she stooped down, turned him over, and examined him; then
sprinkled him with water, and made him drink. He rapidly revived, and
when he was able to stand, she let him go; and he was soon feeding among
his companions as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Beth watched them for a little with the same animal-like expressionless
gravity of countenance, then moved off unconcernedly.</p>

<p>She never mentioned the incident to any one, and never forgot it; but
her only feeling about it was that the pigeon had had a narrow escape.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span>
 was a fine instrument, sensitive to a touch, and, considering the
way she was handled, it would have been a wonder if discordant effects
had not been constantly produced upon her. Hers was a nature with a wide
range. It is probable that every conceivable impulse was latent in her,
every possibility of good or evil. Exactly which would predominate
depended upon the influences of these early years; and almost all the
influences she came under were haphazard. There was no intelligent
direction of her thoughts, no systematic training to form good habits.
Her brothers were sent to school as soon as they were old enough, and so
had the advantage of regular routine and strict discipline from the
first; but a couple of hours a day for lessons was considered enough for
the little girls; and, for the rest of the time, so long as they were on
the premises and not naughty, that is to say, gave no trouble, it was
taken for granted that they were safe, morally and physically. Neither
of their parents seem to have suspected their extreme precocity; and
there is no doubt that Beth suffered seriously in after life from the
mistakes of those in authority over her at this period. People admired
her bright eyes without realising that she could see with them, and not
only that she could see, but that she could not help seeing. But even if
they had realised it, they would merely have scolded her for learning
anything in that way which they preferred that she should not know. They
were not sufficiently intelligent themselves to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> perceive that it is not
what we know of things, but what we think of them, which makes for good
or evil. Beth was accordingly allowed to run wild, and expected to see
nothing; but all the time her mind was being involuntarily stored with
observations from which, in time to come, for want of instruction, she
would be forced to draw her own&mdash;often erroneous&mdash;conclusions.</p>

<p>Kitty's departure was Beth's first great grief, and she suffered
terribly. The prop and stay of her little life had gone, the comfort and
kindness, the order and discipline, which were essential to her nature.
Mrs. Caldwell was a good woman, who would certainly do what she thought
best for her children; but she was exhausted by the unconscionable
production of a too numerous family, a family which she had neither the
means nor the strength to bring up properly. Her husband's health, too,
grew ever more precarious, and she found herself obliged to do all in
her power to help him with his duties, which were arduous. There was a
good deal that she could do in the way of writing official letters and
managing money-matters, tasks for which she was much better fitted than
for the management of children; but the children, meanwhile, had to be
left to the care of others&mdash;not that that would have been a bad thing
for them had their mother had sufficient discrimination to enable her to
choose the proper kind of people to be with them. Unfortunately for
everybody, however, Mrs. Caldwell had been brought up on the
old-fashioned principle that absolute ignorance of human nature is the
best qualification for a wife and mother, and she was consequently quite
unprepared for any possibility which had not formed part of her own
simple and limited personal experience. She never suspected, for one
thing, that a servant's conversation could be undesirable if her
appearance and her character from her last mistress were satisfactory;
and, therefore, when Kitty had gone, she put Anne in her place without
misgiving, Anne's principal recommendation being that she was a
nice-looking girl, and had pretty deferential manners.</p>

<p>Anne came from one of the cabins on the Irish side of the road, where
people, pigs, poultry, with an occasional cow, goat, or donkey herded
together indiscriminately. The windows were about a foot square, and
were not made to open. Sometimes they had glass in them, but were
oftener stopped up with rags. Before the doors were heaps of manure and
pools of stagnant water. There was no regular footway, but a mere beaten
track in front of the cabins, and this, on wet days, was ankle-deep in
mud. The women hung about the doors all day long, knitting the men's
blue stockings, and did little else apparently. Both men and women were
usually in a torpid state, the result, doubtless, of breathing a
poisoned atmosphere, and of insufficient food.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> It took strong
stimulants to rouse them: love, hate, jealousy, whisky, battle, murder,
and sudden death. Their conversation was gross, and they were very
immoral; but it is hardly necessary to say so, for with men, women,
children, and animals all crowded together in such surroundings, and the
morbid craving for excitement to which people who have no comfort or
wholesome interest in life fall a prey, immorality is inevitable. It was
the boast of the place that there were no illegitimate children; it
would have been a better sign if there had been.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell, true to her training, lived opposite to all this vice and
squalor, serenely indifferent to it. Anne, therefore, who knew nothing
about the management of children, and was not in any respect a proper
person to have the charge of them, had it all her own way in the
nursery: and her way was to do nothing that she could help. She used to
call the children in the morning, and then leave them to their own
devices. The moment they were awake, which was pretty soon, for they
were full of life, they began to batter each other with pillows, dance
about the room in their night-dresses, pitch tents with the bed-clothes
on the floor, and make noise enough to bring their mother down upon
them. Then Anne would be summoned and come hurrying up, and help them to
huddle on their clothes somehow. She never washed them, but encouraged
them to perform their own ablutions, which they did with the end of a
towel dipped in a jug. The consequence was they were generally in a very
dirty state. They took their meals with their parents, and papa would
notice the dirt eventually, and storm at mamma in Italian, when words
would ensue in a tone which made the children quake. Then mamma would
storm at Anne, for whom the children felt sorry, and the result would be
a bath, which they bore with fortitude, for fear of getting Anne into
further trouble. They even made good resolutions about washing
themselves, which they kept for a few days; then, however, they began to
shirk again, and had again to be scrubbed. The resolutions of a child
must be shored up by kindly supervision, otherwise it is hardly likely
that they will cement into good habits.</p>

<p>Beth suffered from a continual sense of discomfort in those days for
want of proper attention. All her clothing fitted badly, and were
fastened on with anything that came to hand in the way of tape and
buttons; her hair was ill brushed, and she was so continually found
fault with that her sense of self-respect was checked in its
development, and she lost all faith in her own power to do anything
right or well. The consequence was the most profound disheartenment,
endured in silence, with the exquisite uncomplaining fortitude of a
little child. It made its mark on her countenance, however, in a settled
expression of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
 discontent, which, being mistaken for a bad disposition,
repelled people, and made her many enemies. People generally said that
Mildred was a dear, but Beth did not look pleasant; and for many a long
day to come, very few troubled themselves to try and make her look so.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Beth's parents neglected their children. On the
contrary, her father thought much of their education, and of their
future; it was the all-importance of the present that did not strike
him, and so with her mother. Neither parent was careless, but their care
stopped short too soon; and it is astonishing the amount of liberty the
children had. They were sent out of doors as soon as they were dressed
in the morning, because sunshine and air are so essential to children.
If they went for a walk, Anne accompanied them; but very often Anne was
wanted, and then the children were left to loiter about the garden or
stable-yard, where, doubtless with the help of reasoning powers much in
advance of her age, Beth had soon heard and seen enough to make her feel
a certain contempt for her father's veracity when he told her that she
had originally been brought to the house in the doctor's black bag.</p>

<p>After Kitty's departure Beth had many a lonely hour, and the time hung
heavy on her hands. Mildred, her senior by four years, was of a simpler
disposition, and always able to amuse herself, playing with the Baby
Bernadine, or with toys which were no distraction to Beth. Mildred,
besides, was fond of reading; but books to be deciphered remained a
wonder and a mystery to Beth.</p>

<p>Jim went to the national school, the only one in the place, with all the
other little boys. The master was a young curate who gave Mildred and
Beth their lessons also, when school-hours were over. Beth used to yearn
for lesson-time, just for the sake of being obliged to do something; but
lessons were disappointing, for the curate devoted himself to Mildred,
who was docile and studious, and took no special pains to interest Beth,
and consequently she soon wearied of the dull restraint, and became
troublesome. Sometimes she was boisterous, and then the tutor had to
spend half his time in chasing her to rescue his hat, a book, an
ink-bottle, or some other article which she threatened to destroy; and,
sometimes she was so depressed that he had to give up trying to teach
her, and just do his best to distract her. In her eighth year she was
able to follow the church-service in the prayer-book, and make out the
hymns, but that was all.</p>

<p>Sunday-school was held in the church, and was attended by all the
unmarried parishioners. Mildred taught some of the tiny mites, and Beth
was put into her class at first; but Beth had no respect for Mildred,
and had consequently to be removed.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
 She was expected to learn the
collect for the day and the verse of a hymn every Sunday, but never by
any chance knew either. No one ever thought of reading the thing over to
her, and fixing her attention on it by some little explanation; and
learning by heart from a book did not come naturally to her. She learned
by ear easily enough, but not by sight. The hymns and prayers which
Kitty had repeated to her, she very soon picked up; but Kitty had true
sympathetic insight to inform her of what the child required, and all
her little lessons were proper to some occasion, and had comfort in
them. What Beth learned now, on the contrary, often filled her with
gloom. Some of the hymns, such as,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;"When gathering clouds around I view,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And days are dark, and friends are few,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>made her especially miserable. It was always a dark day to her when she
repeated it, with heavy clouds collecting overhead, and herself, a
solitary little speck on the mountain side wandering alone.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is significant to note that church figures largely in Beth's
recollection of this time, but religion not at all. There was, in fact,
no connection between the two in her mind.</p>

<p>Both Captain and Mrs. Caldwell protested strongly against what they
called cant; and they seemed to have called everything cant except an
occasional cold reading aloud of the Bible on Sundays, and the bald
observance of the church service. The Bible they read aloud to the
children without expounding it, and the services they attended without
comment. Displays of religious emotion in everyday life they regarded as
symptoms of insanity; and if they heard people discuss religion with
enthusiasm, and profess to love the Lord, they were genuinely shocked.
All that kind of thing they thought "such cant," "and so like those
horrid dissenters;" which made them extra careful that the children
should hear nothing of the sort. This, from their point of view, was
right and wise; in Beth's case especially; for her unsatisfied soul was
of the quality which soon yearns for the fine fulness of faith; her
little heart would have filled to bursting with her first glad
conception of the love divine, and her whole being would have stirred to
speak her emotion, even though speech meant martyrdom. Thanks to the
precautions of her parents, however, she heard nothing to stimulate her
natural tendency to religious fervour after Kitty's departure; and
gradually the image of our Blessed Lady faded from her mind, and was
succeeded by that of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
 God of her parents, a death-dealing deity,
delighting in blood, whom she was warned to fear, and from whom she did
accordingly shrink with such holy horror that, when she went to church,
she tried to think of anything but Him. This was how it happened that
church, instead of being the threshold of the next world to her mind,
became the centre of this, where she made many interesting observations
of men and manners; for in spite of her backwardness in the schoolroom,
Beth's intellect advanced with a bound at this period. She had left her
native place an infant, on whose mind some chance impressions had been
made and lingered; she arrived at Castletownrock with the power to
observe for herself, and even to reflect upon what she saw&mdash;of course to
a certain extent only; but still the power had come, and was far in
advance of her years. So far, it was circumstances that had impressed
her; she knew one person from another, but that was all. Now, however,
she began to be interested in people for themselves, apart from any
incident in which they figured; and most of her time was spent in a
curiously close, but quite involuntary study of those about her, and of
their relations to each other.</p>

<p>Church was often a sore penance to the children, it was so long, and
cold, and dull; but they set off on Sunday happy in the consciousness of
their best hats and jackets, nevertheless; and the first part of the
time was not so bad, for then they had Sunday-school, and the three
Misses Keene&mdash;Mary, Sophia, and Lenore&mdash;and the two Misses Mayne, Honor
and Kathleen, and Mr. and Mrs. Small, the Vicar and his wife, and the
curate, were all there talking and teaching. Beth remembered nothing
about the teaching except that, on one occasion, Mr. Macbean, the
rector, tried to explain the meaning of the trefoil on the ends of the
pews to Mildred and herself; but she could think of nothing but the way
his beard wagged as he spoke, and was disconcerted when he questioned
her. He had promised to be a friend to Beth; but he was a delicate man,
and not able to live much at Castletownrock, where the climate was
rigorous; so that she seldom saw him.</p>

<p>When Sunday-school was over, the children went up to the gallery; their
pew and the Keenes', roomy boxes, took up the whole front of it. Mrs.
Caldwell always sat up in the gallery with the children, but Captain
Caldwell often sat downstairs in the rectory-pew to be near the fire;
when he sat in the gallery he wore a little black cap to keep off the
draught. He and Mr. O'Halloran the Squire, and Captain Keene, stood and
talked in the aisle sometimes before the service commenced. One Sunday
they kept looking up at the children in the gallery.</p>

<p>"I'll bet Mildred will be the handsomest woman," Mr. O'Halloran was
saying.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll back Beth," Captain Keene observed. "If all the men in the place
are not after her soon, I'm no judge of her sex, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't look at me!" said Captain Caldwell complacently. "I can't
pretend to say. But let's hope that they'll go off well, at all events.
They'll have every chance I can give them of making good matches."</p>

<p>Beth heard her father repeat this conversation to her mother afterwards,
but was too busy wondering what a handsome woman was to understand that
it was her own charms which had been appraised; but Mildred understood,
and was elated.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Halloran, the squire, had a red beard, which was an offence to
Beth. His wife wore bonnets about which everybody used to make remarks
to Mrs. Caldwell. Beth understood that Mrs. O'Halloran was young and
pretty, and had three charming children, but was not happy because of
Sophia Keene.</p>

<p>"Just fancy," she heard Mrs. Small, the Vicar's wife, say to her mother
once. "Just fancy, he was in a carriage with them at the races, and
stayed with Sophia the whole time; and poor Mrs. O'Halloran left at home
alone. I call it scandalous. But you know what Sophia is!" Mrs. Small
concluded significantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell drew herself up, and looked at Mrs. Small, but said
nothing; yet somehow Beth knew that she too was unhappy because of
Sophia Keene. Beth was not on familiar terms with her mother, and would
not have dared to embrace her spontaneously, or make any other
demonstration of affection; but she was loyally devoted to her all the
same, and would gladly have stabbed Sophia Keene, and have done battle
with the whole of the rest of the family on her mother's behalf had
occasion offered.</p>

<p>She was curled up among the fuchsias on the window-seat of the
sitting-room one day, unobserved by her parents, who entered the room
together after she had settled herself there, and began to discuss the
Keenes.</p>

<p>"You did not tell me, Henry, you spent all your time with them before we
came," Mrs. Caldwell said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" he answered, with a jaunty affectation of ease.</p>

<p>"It is not why you should," his wife said with studied gentleness, "but
why you should not. It seems so strange, making a mystery of it."</p>

<p>"I described old Keene to you&mdash;the old buffalo!" he replied; "and I'll
describe the girls now if you like. Mary is a gawk, Sophia is as yellow
as a duck's foot, and Lenore is half-witted."</p>

<p>The Keenes were ignorant, idle, good-tempered young women, and kind to
the children, whom they often took to bathe with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> them. They were seldom
able to go into the sea itself, for it was a wild, tempestuous coast;
but there were lovely clear pools on the rocky shore, natural stone
baths left full of water when the tide went out, sheltered from the wind
by tall, dark, precipitous cliffs, and warmed by the sun; and there they
used to dabble by the hour together. Anne went with them, and it was a
pretty sight, the four young women in white chemises that clung to them
when wet, and the three lovely children&mdash;little white nudities with
bright brown hair&mdash;scampering over the rocks, splashing each other in
the pools, or lying about on warm sunny slabs, resting and chattering.
One day Beth found some queer things in a pool, and Sophia told her they
were barnacles.</p>

<p>"They stick to the bottom of a ship," she said, "and grow heavier and
heavier till at last the ship can make no more way, and comes to a
standstill in a shining sea, where the water is as smooth as a mirror;
you would think it was a mirror, in fact, if it did not heave gently up
and down like your breast when you breathe; and every time it heaves it
flushes some colour, blue, or green, or pink, or purple. And the
barnacles swell and swell at the bottom of the ship, till at last they
burst in two with a loud report; and then the sailors rush to the side
of the ship and look over, and there they see a flock of beautiful big
white geese coming up out of the water; and sometimes they shoot the
geese, but if they do a great storm comes on and engulfs the ship, and
they are all drowned; but sometimes they stand stockstill, amazed, and
then the birds rise up out of the air on their great white wings, up,
up, drifting along, together, till they look like the clouds over there.
Then a gentle breeze springs up, and the ship sails away safely into
port."</p>

<p>"And where do the geese go?" Beth demanded, with breathless interest.</p>

<p>"They make for the shore too, and in the dead of winter, on stormy
nights, they fly over the land, uttering strange cries, and if you wake
and hear them, it means somebody is going to die."</p>

<p>Beth's eyes were staring far out beyond the great green Atlantic rollers
that came bursting in round the sheltering headland, white-crested with
foam, flying up the beach with a crash, and scattering showers of spray
that sparkled in the sunshine. She could see the ships and the
barnacles, and the silent sea, heaving great sighs and flushing with
fine colour in the act; and the geese, and the sailors peering over the
side and shooting at them and sinking immediately in a storm, but also
sailing into a safe haven triumphantly, where the sun shone on white
houses, although, at the same time, it was dark night, and overhead
there were strange cries that made her cower&mdash;"Beth!" cried Sophia,
"what's the matter with you, child?"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth returned with a start, and stared at her&mdash;"I know who it will be,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Who what'll be, Miss Beth?" Anne asked in awe.</p>

<p>"Who'll die," said Beth.</p>

<p>"You mustn't say, Beth; you'll bring bad luck if you do," Miss Keene
interposed hastily.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to say," Beth answered dreamily; "but I know."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have told the child that story, miss," Anne said. "Shure,
ye know what she is&mdash;she sees." Anne nodded her head several times
significantly.</p>

<p>"I forgot," said Sophia.</p>

<p>"She'll forget too," said Mary philosophically. "I say, Beth," she went
on, raising herself on her elbow&mdash;she was lying prone on a slab of rock
in the sun&mdash;"what does your mother think of us?"</p>

<p>Beth roused herself. "I don't know," she answered earnestly; "she never
says. But I know what papa thinks of you. He says Mary's a gawk, Sophia
is as yellow as a duck's foot, and Lenore is only half-witted."</p>

<p>The effect of this announcement astonished Beth. The Misses Keene,
instead of being interested, all looked at her as if they did not like
her, and Anne burst out laughing. When they got in, Anne told Mrs.
Caldwell, who flushed suddenly, and covered her mouth with her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," Mildred exclaimed with importance, "Beth did say so. And
Mary tossed her head, and Sophia sneered."</p>

<p>"What is sneered?" Beth demanded importunately. "What is sneered?"</p>

<p>"O Beth! don't bother so," Mildred exclaimed irritably. "It's when you
curl up your lip."</p>

<p>"Beth, how could you be so naughty?" Mrs. Caldwell said at last from
behind her handkerchief. "Don't you know you should never repeat things
you hear said? A lady never repeats a private conversation."</p>

<p>"What's a private conversation?" said Beth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell gave her a broad definition, during which she lowered her
handkerchief, and Beth discovered that she was trying not to smile.</p>

<p>This was Beth's first lesson in honour, which was her mother's god, and
she felt the influence of it all her life.</p>

<p>Later in the day, Beth was curled up on the window-seat among the
fuchsias, looking out. Behind the thatched cabins opposite, the sombre
mountains rolled up, dark and distinct, to the sky; but Beth would not
look at them if she could help it, they oppressed her. It was a close
afternoon, and the window

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
 was wide open. A bare-legged woman, in a
short petticoat, stood in an indolent attitude leaning against a
door-post opposite; a young man in low shoes, light blue stockings, buff
knee-breeches, a blue-tailed coat with brass buttons, and a soft
high-crowned felt hat, came strolling up the street with his hands in
his pockets.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Biddy," he remarked, as he passed the woman, "you're all
swelled."</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered tranquilly, "I've been drinking buttermilk."</p>

<p>"Well, let's hope it'll be a boy," he rejoined.</p>

<p>The woman looked up and down the street complacently.</p>

<p>Presently Beth saw Honor and Kathleen Mayne come out of the inn. The
Maynes used to pet the children and play the piano to them when they
were at the inn, and had been very good to Jim also when he was there
alone with his father before the family arrived. Their manners were
gentle and caressing, and they did their best to win their way into Mrs.
Caldwell's good graces, but at first she coldly repulsed them, which
hurt Beth very much. The Maynes, however, did not at all understand that
they were being repulsed. A kindly feeling existed among all classes in
those remote Irish villages. The squire's family, the doctor's,
clergyman's, draper's, and innkeeper's visited each other, and shook
hands when they met. There was no feeling of condescension on the one
hand, or of pretension on the other; but Mrs. Caldwell had the strong
class prejudice which makes such stupid snobs of the English. It was not
<i>what</i> people were, but <i>who</i> they were, that was all important to her;
and she would have bowed down cheerfully, as whole neighbourhoods do,
and felt exhilarated by the notice of some stupid county magnate, who
had not heart enough to be loved, head enough to distinguish himself, or
soul enough to get him into heaven. She was a lady, and Mayne was an
innkeeper. His daughters might amuse the children, but as to associating
with Mrs. Caldwell, that was absurd!</p>

<p>The girls were not to be rebuffed, however. They persevered in their
kindly attentions, making excuses to each other for Mrs. Caldwell's
manner; explaining her coldness by the fact that she was English, and
flattering her, until finally they won their way into her good graces,
and so effectually too, that when they brought a young magpie in a
basket for Beth one day, her mother graciously allowed her to accept it.</p>

<p>Beth liked the Maynes, but now as they came up the road she slid from
the window-seat. She knew they would stop and talk if she waited, and
she did not want to talk. She was thinking about something, and it
irritated her to be interrupted.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
 So she tore across the hall and
through the kitchen out into the yard, impelled by an imperative desire
to be alone.</p>

<p>The magpie was the first pet of her own she had ever had, and she loved
it. At night it was chained to a perch stuck in the wall of the
stable-yard. On the other side of that wall was the yard of Murphy the
farrier. The magpie soon became tame enough to be let loose by day, and
Beth always went to release it the first thing in the morning and give
it its breakfast. It came hopping to meet her now, and followed her into
the garden. The garden was entered by an archway under the outbuildings,
which divided it from the stable-yard. It was very long, but narrow for
its length. On the right was a high wall, but on the left was a low
one&mdash;at least one half of it was low&mdash;and Beth could look over it into
the farrier's garden next door. The other half had been raised by
Captain Caldwell on the understanding that if he raised one half the
farrier would raise the other, but the farrier had proved perfidious.
The wall was built without mortar, of rough, uncut stones. Captain
Caldwell had his half neatly finished off at the top with sods, but
Murphy's piece was still all broken down. The children used to climb up
by it on to the raised half, and dance there at the risk of life and
limb, and jeer at Murphy as he dug his potatoes, calling his attention
to the difference between the Irish and English half of the wall, till
he lost his temper and pelted them. This was the signal for a battle.
The children returned his potatoes with stones by way of interest, and
hit him as often as he hit them. (Needless to say, their parents were
not in the garden at the time.) They had a great contempt for the
farrier because he fought them, and he used to go about the village
complaining of them and their "tratement" of him, "the little divils,
spoilin' the pace of the whole neighbourhood."</p>

<p>There was a high wall at the end of the garden, and Beth liked to sit on
the top of it. She went there now, picked up her magpie, and climbed up
with difficulty by way of Pat Murphy's broken bit. Immediately below her
was a muddy lane, beyond which the land sloped down to the sea, and as
she sat there, the sound of the waves, that dreamy, soft murmur for
which we have no word, filled the interstices of her consciousness with
something that satisfied.</p>

<p>She was not left long in peace to enjoy it that afternoon, however, for
the farrier was at work in his garden below, and presently he looked up
and saw the magpie.</p>

<p>"There ye are agin, Miss Beth, wi' yer baste of a burrd; bad luck to
it!" he exclaimed, crossing himself. "Shure, don't I tell ye ivery day
uf your life it's wan fur sorrow."</p>

<p>"Bad luck to yerself, Pat Murphy," Beth rejoined promptly.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> "It's a
foine cheek ye have to be spakin' to a gentleman's daughter, an' you not
a man uv yer wurrd."</p>

<p>"Not a man o' me wurrd! what d'ye mane?" said Murphy, firing.</p>

<p>"Look at that wall," Beth answered; "didn't ye promise ye'd build it?"</p>

<p>"An' so I will when yer father gives me the stones he promised me,"
Murphy replied. "It's a moighty foine mon uv his wurrd he is."</p>

<p>"Is it my father yer maning, Pat Murphy?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"It is," he said, sticking his spade in the ground emphatically.</p>

<p>"Ye know yer lying," said Beth. "My father promised you no stones. He's
not a fool."</p>

<p>"I niver met a knave that was," Pat observed, turning over a huge
spadeful of earth, and then straightening himself to look up at her.</p>

<p>Beth's instinct was always to fight when she was in a rage; words break
no bones, and she preferred to break bones at such times. It was some
seconds before she saw the full force of Pat's taunt, but the moment she
did, she seized the largest loose stone within reach on the top of the
wall, and shied it at him. It struck him full in the face, and cut his
cheek open.</p>

<p>"That'll teach ye," said Beth, blazing.</p>

<p>The man turned on her with a very ugly look.</p>

<p>"Put yer spade down," she said. "I'm not afraid of you."</p>

<p>"Miss Beth! Miss Beth!" some one called from the end of the garden.</p>

<p>Murphy stuck his spade in the ground, and wiped his jaw. "Ye'll pay for
this, ye divil's limb," he muttered, "yew an' yours."</p>

<p>"Miss Beth! Miss Beth!"</p>

<p>"I'm coming!" Beth rejoined irritably, and slid from the wall to the
ground regardless of the rough loose stones she scattered in her
descent. "Ye'll foind me ready to pay when ye send in yer bill, Pat,"
she called out as she ran down the garden.</p>

<p>The children were to have tea at the vicarage that day, and Anne had
been sent to fetch her.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room at the vicarage there was a big bay-window which
looked out across a desolate stretch of bog to a wild headland, against
which the waves beat tempestuously in almost all weathers. The headland
itself was high, but the giant breakers often dashed up far above it,
and fell in showers of spray on the grass at the top. There was a
telescope in the window at the vicarage, and people used to come to see
the sight, and went into raptures over it. Beth, standing out of the
way, unnoticed, would gaze too, fascinated; but it was the attraction of
repulsion. The cruel force of the great waves agitated her,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> and at the
same time made her unutterably sad. Her heart beat painfully when she
watched them, her breath became laboured, and it was only with an effort
that she could keep back her sobs. It was not fear that oppressed her,
but a horrible sort of excitement, which so gained upon her on that
afternoon in particular that she felt she must shriek aloud, or make her
escape. If she showed any emotion she would be laughed at, if she made
her escape she would probably be whipped; she preferred to be whipped;
so, watching her opportunity, she quietly slipped away.</p>

<p>At home the window of the sitting-room was still wide open, and as she
ran down the street she noticed some country people peeping in
curiously, and apparently astonished by the luxury they beheld. Beth,
who was picking up Irish rapidly, understood some exclamations she
overheard as she approached, and felt flattered for the furniture.</p>

<p>She ran up the steps and opened the front door: "Good day to ye all,"
she said sociably; "will ye not come in and have a look round? now do!"</p>

<p>She led the way as she spoke, and the country people followed her, all
agape. In the hall they paused to wonder at the cocoanut matting; but
when they stood on the soft pile carpet, so grateful to their bare feet,
in the sitting-room, and looked round, they lowered their voices
respectfully, and this gave Beth a sudden sensation of superiority. She
began to show them the things: the pictures on the walls, the subjects
of which she explained to them; the egg-shell china, which she held up
to the light that they might see how thin it was; and some Eastern and
Western curios her father had brought home from various voyages. She
told them of tropical heat and Canadian cold, and began to be elated
herself when she found all that she had ever heard on the subject
flowing fluently from her lips.</p>

<p>The front door had been left open, and the passers-by looked in to see
what was going on, and then entered uninvited. Neighbours, too, came
over from the Irish side of the road, so that the room gradually filled,
and as her audience increased, Beth grew excited and talked away
eloquently.</p>

<p>"Lord," one man exclaimed with a sigh, on looking round the room, "it's
aisy to see why the likes of these looks down on the likes of us."</p>

<p>"Eh, dear, yes!" a woman with a petticoat over her head solemnly
responded.</p>

<p>"The durrty heretics," a slouching fellow, with a flat white face,
muttered under his breath. "But if they benefit here, they'll burn
hereafter, holy Jasus be praised."</p>

<p>"Will they?" said Beth, turning on him. "Will they burrn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> hereafter,
Bap-faced Flanagan? No, they won't! They'll hunt ye out of heaven as
they hunted ye out o' Maclone.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the Orange militia walked into Maclone,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And hunted the Catholics out of the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ri' turen nuren nuren naddio,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Right tur nuren nee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She sang it out at the top of her shrill little voice, executing a
war-dance of defiance to the tune, and concluding with an elaborate
curtsey.</p>

<p>As she recovered herself, she became aware of her father standing in the
doorway. His lips were white, and there was a queer look in his face.</p>

<p>"Oh! So this is <i>your</i> party, is it, Miss Beth?" he said. "You ask your
friends in, and then you insult them, I see."</p>

<p>Beth was still effervescing. She put her hands behind her back and
answered boldly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Deed, thin, he insulted me, papa. It was Bap-faced Flanagan. He said
we were durrty heretics, and&mdash;and&mdash;I'll not stand that! It's a free
country!"</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell looked round, and the people melted from the room under
his eye. Then Anne appeared from somewhere.</p>

<p>"Anne, do you teach the children party-songs?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Shure, they don't need taching, yer honour," said Anne, disconcerted.
"Miss Beth knows 'em all, and she shouts 'em at the top of her voice
down the street till the men shake their fists at her."</p>

<p>"Why do you do that, Beth?" her father demanded.</p>

<p>"I like to feel," Beth began, gasping out each word with a mighty effort
to express herself&mdash;"I like to feel&mdash;that I can <i>make</i> them shake their
fists."</p>

<p>Her father looked at her again very queerly.</p>

<p>"Will I take her to the nursery, sir?" Anne asked.</p>

<p>Beth turned on her impatiently, and said something in Irish which made
Anne grin. Beth did not understand her father in this mood, and she
wanted to see more of him.</p>

<p>"What's that she's saying to you, Anne?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;sure, she's just blessin' me, yer honour," Anne answered unabashed.</p>

<p>"I believe you!" Captain Caldwell said dryly, as he stretched himself on
the sofa. "Go and fetch a hair-brush."</p>

<p>While Anne was out of the room he turned to Beth. "I'll give you a
penny," he said, "if you'll tell me what you said to Anne."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you for nothing," Beth answered. "I said, 'Yer soul to the
devil for an interfering hussy.'"</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell burst out laughing, and laughed till Anne returned with
the brush. "Now, brush my hair," he said to Beth; and Beth went and
stood beside the sofa, and brushed, and brushed, now with one hand, and
now with the other, till she ached all over with the effort. Her father
suffered from atrocious headaches, and this was the one thing that
relieved him.</p>

<p>"There, that's punishment enough for to-day," he said at last.</p>

<p>Beth retired to the foot of the couch, and leant there, looking at him
solemnly, with the hair-brush still in her hand. "That's no punishment,"
she observed.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I mean I like it," she said. "I'd brush till I dropped if it did you
any good."</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell looked up at her, and it was as if he had seen the
child for the first time.</p>

<p>"Beth," he said, after a while, "would you like to come out with me on
the car to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"'Deed, then, I would, papa," Beth answered eagerly.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause, during which Beth rubbed her back against the
end of the couch thoughtfully, and looked at the wall opposite as if she
could see through it. Her father watched her for a little time with a
frown upon his forehead from the pain in his head.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, Beth?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"I've got to be whipped to-night," she answered drearily; "and I wish I
hadn't. I do get so tired of being whipped and shaken."</p>

<p>Her little face looked pinched and pathetic as she spoke, and for the
first time her father had a suspicion of what punishment was to this
child&mdash;a thing as inevitable as disease, a continually recurring
torture, but quite without effect upon her conduct&mdash;and his heart
contracted with a qualm of pity.</p>

<p>"What are you going to be whipped for now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We went to tea at the vicarage, and I ran away home."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because of the great green waves. They rush up the
rocks&mdash;wish&mdash;st&mdash;st!" (she took a step forward, and threw up her little
arms in illustration)&mdash;"then fall, and roll back, and gather, and come
rushing on again; and I feel every time&mdash;every time&mdash;that they are
coming right at me!"&mdash;she clutched her throat as if she were
suffocating; "and if I had stayed I should have shrieked, and then I
should have been whipped. So I came away."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you expect to be whipped for coming away?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But you see I don't have the waves as well. And mamma won't say I
was afraid."</p>

<p>"Were you afraid, Beth?" her father asked.</p>

<p>"No!" Beth retorted, stamping her foot indignantly. "If the waves did
come at me, I could stand it. It's the coming&mdash;coming&mdash;coming&mdash;I can't
bear. It makes me ache here." She clutched at her throat and chest
again.</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell closed his eyes. He felt that he was beginning to make
this child's acquaintance, and wished he had tried to cultivate it
sooner.</p>

<p>"You shall not be whipped to-night, Beth," he said presently, looking at
her with a kindly smile.</p>

<p>Instantly an answering smile gleamed on the child's face, transfiguring
her; and, by the light of it, her father realised how seldom he had seen
her smile.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Beth, however, while her countenance was still
irradiated, her mother swooped down upon her. Mrs. Caldwell had come
hurrying home in a rage in search of Beth; and now, mistaking that smile
for a sign of defiance, she seized upon her, and had beaten her severely
before it was possible to interfere. Beth, dazed by this sudden
onslaught, staggered when she let her go, and stretched out her little
hands as if groping for some support.</p>

<p>"It wasn't your fault!&mdash;it wasn't your fault!" she gasped, her first
instinct being to exonerate her father.</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell had started up and caught his wife by the arm.</p>

<p>"That's enough," he said harshly. "You are going altogether the wrong
way to work with the child. Let this be the last time, do you
understand? Beth, go to the nursery, and ask Anne to get you some tea."
A sharp pain shot through his head. He had jumped up too quickly, and
now fell back on the sofa with a groan.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me brush it again," Beth cried, in an agony of sympathy.</p>

<p>Her father opened his haggard eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>"Go to the nursery, like a good child," he said, "and get some tea."</p>

<p>Beth went without another word. But all that evening her mind was with
her parents in the sitting-room, wondering&mdash;wondering what they were
saying to each other.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span>
 day Beth jumped out of bed early, and washed herself all over, in
an excess of grateful zeal, because she was to be taken out on the car.
As soon as she had had her breakfast, she ran into the yard to feed her
magpie. Its perch was in a comfortable corner sheltered by the great
turf-stack which had been built up against the wall that divided the
Caldwells' yard from that of Pat Murphy, the farrier. Beth, in wild
spirits, ran round the stack, calling "Mag, Mag!" as she went. But Mag,
alas! was never more to respond to her call. He was hanging by the leg
from his perch, head downward, wings outstretched, and glossy feathers
ruffled; and below him, on the ground, some stones were scattered which
told the tale of cruelty and petty spite.</p>

<p>Beth stood for a moment transfixed; but in that moment the whole thing
became clear to her&mdash;the way in which the deed was done, the man that
did it, and his motive. She glanced up to the top of the high wall, and
then, breathing thick through her clenched teeth, in her rage she
climbed up the turf-stack with the agility of a cat, and looked over
into the farrier's yard.</p>

<p>"Come out of that, Pat Murphy, ye black-hearted, murthering villain,"
she shrieked. "I see ye skulking there behind the stable-door. Come out,
I tell ye, and bad luck to you for killing my bird."</p>

<p>"Is it me, miss?" Pat Murphy exclaimed, appearing with an injured and
innocent look on his face. "Me kill yer burrd! Shure, thin, ye never
thought such a thing uv me!"</p>

<p>"Didn't I, thin! and I think it still," Beth cried. "Say, 'May I never
see heaven if I kilt it'&mdash;or I'll curse ye."</p>

<p>"Ah, thin, it isn't such bad language ye'd hev me be using, and you a
young lady, Miss Beth," said Pat in a wheedling tone.</p>

<p>"'Deed, thin, it is, Pat Murphy; but I know ye daresn't say it," said
Beth. "Oh, bad luck to ye! bad luck to ye every day ye see a wooden
milestone, and twice every day ye don't. And if ye killed my bird, may
the devil attend ye, to rob ye of what ye like best wherever ye are."</p>

<p>She slid down the stack when she had spoken, and found her father
standing at the bottom, looking at the dead bird with a heavy frown on
his dark face. He must have heard Beth's altercation with Murphy, but he
made no remark until Mrs. Caldwell came out, when he said something in
Italian, to which she responded, "The cowardly brute!"</p>

<p>Beth took her bird, and buried it deep in her little garden, by which
time the car was ready. She had not shed a tear, nor did

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> she ever
mention the incident afterwards; which was characteristic, for she was
always shy of showing any feeling but anger.</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell had a wild horse called Artless, which few men would
have cared to ride, and fewer still have driven. People wondered that he
took his children out on the car behind such an animal, and perhaps he
would not have done so if he had had his own way, but Mrs. Caldwell
insisted on it.</p>

<p>"They've no base blood in them," she said; "and I'll not have them
allowed to acquire any affectation of timidity."</p>

<p>Artless was particularly fresh that morning. He was a red chestnut, with
a white star on his forehead, and one white stocking.</p>

<p>When Beth returned to the stable-yard she found him fidgeting between
the shafts, with his ears laid back, and the whites of his wicked eyes
showing, and Riley struggling with his head in a hard endeavour to keep
him quiet enough for the family to mount the car. Captain and Mrs.
Caldwell and Mildred were already in their seats, and Beth scrambled up
to hers unconcernedly, although Artless was springing about in a lively
manner at the moment. Beth sat next her father, who drove from the side
of the car, and then they were ready to be off as soon as Artless would
go; but Artless objected to leave the yard, and Riley had to lead him
round and round, running at his head, and coaxing him, while Captain
Caldwell gathered up the reins and held the whip in suspense, watching
his opportunity each time they passed the gate to give Artless a start
that would make him bound through it. Round and round they went,
however, several times, with Artless rearing, backing, and plunging; but
at last the whip came down at the right moment, just the slightest
flick, Riley let go his head, and out he dashed in his indignation, the
battle ending in a wild gallop up the street, with the car swinging
behind him, and the whole of the Irish side of the road out cheering and
encouraging, to the children's great delight. But their ebullition of
glee was a little too much for their father's nerves.</p>

<p>"These children of yours are perfect little devils, Caroline!" he
exclaimed irritably. Mrs. Caldwell smiled as at a compliment. She had
been brought up on horseback herself, and insisted on teaching the
children to regard danger as a diversion&mdash;not that that was difficult,
for they were naturally daring. She would have punished them promptly on
the slightest suspicion of timidity. "Only base-born people were
cowardly," she scornfully maintained. "No lady ever shows a sign of
fear."</p>

<p>Once, when they were crossing Achen sands, a wide waste, innocent of any
obstacle, Artless came down without warning, and Mildred uttered an
exclamation.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was it made that ridiculous noise?" Mrs. Caldwell asked, looking
hard at Beth.</p>

<p>Beth could not clear herself without accusing her sister, so she said
nothing, but sat, consumed with fiery indignation; and for long
afterwards she would wake up at night, and clench her little fists, and
burn again, remembering how her mother had supposed she was afraid.</p>

<p>Artless went at breakneck speed that day, shied at the most unexpected
moments, bolted right round, and stopped short occasionally; but Beth
sat tight mechanically, following her own fancies. Captain Caldwell was
going to inspect one of the outlying coastguard stations; and they went
by the glen road, memorable to Beth because it was there she first felt
the charm of running water, and found her first wild violets and tuft of
primroses. The pale purple of the violets and the scent of primroses,
warm with the sun, were among the happy associations of that time. But
her delight was in the mountain-streams, with their mimic waterfalls and
fairy wells. She loved to loiter by them, to watch them bubbling and
sparkling over the rocks, to dabble her hands and feet in them, or to
lie her length upon the turf beside them, in keen consciousness of the
incessant, delicate, delicious murmur of the water, a sound which
conveyed to her much more than can be expressed in articulate speech. At
times too, when she was tired of loitering, she would look up and see
the mountain-top just above her, and begin to climb; but always when she
came to the spot, there was the mountain-top just as far above her as
before; so she used to think that the mountain really reached the sky.</p>

<p>When they returned, late that afternoon, Riley met them with a very
serious face, and told Captain Caldwell mysteriously that Pat Murphy's
horse was ill.</p>

<p>"What a d&mdash;&mdash;d unfortunate coincidence," Captain Caldwell muttered to
his wife; and Beth noticed that her mother's face, which had looked
fresh and bright from the drive, settled suddenly into its habitual
anxious, careworn expression.</p>

<p>Beth loitered about the yard till her parents had gone in; then she
climbed the turf-stack, and looked over. The sick horse was tied to the
stable-door, and stood, hanging his head with a very woebegone
expression, and groaning monotonously. Murphy was trying to persuade him
to take something hot out of a bucket, while Bap-faced Flanagan and
another man, known as Tony-kill-the-cow, looked on and gave good advice.</p>

<p>Beth's fury revived when she saw Murphy, and she laughed aloud
derisively. All three men started and looked up, then crossed
themselves.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell ye, Pat!" Beth exclaimed. "Ye may save

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> yourself the
trouble of doctoring him. He's as dead as my magpie."</p>

<p>Murphy looked much depressed. "Shure, Miss Beth, the poor baste done ye
no harm," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"No," said Beth, "nor my bird hadn't done you any harm, nor the cow Tony
cut the tail off hadn't done him any harm."</p>

<p>"I didn't kill yer burrd," Murphy asserted doggedly.</p>

<p>"We'll see," said Beth. "When the horse dies we'll know who killed the
bird. Then one of you skunks can try and kill me. But I'd advise you to
use a silver bullet; and if you miss, you'll be damned.&mdash;Blast ye,
Riley, will ye let me alone!"</p>

<p>Riley, hearing what was going on, and having called to her vainly to
hold her tongue, had climbed the stack himself, and now laid hold of
her. Beth struck him in the face promptly, whereupon he shook her, and
loosening her hold of the wall, began to carry her down&mdash;a perilous
proceeding, for the stack was steep, and Beth, enraged at the indignity,
doubled herself up and scratched and bit and kicked the whole way to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Ye little divil," said Riley, setting her on her feet, "ye'll get us
all into trouble wid that blasted tongue o' yours."</p>

<p>"Who's afraid?" said Beth, shaking her tousled head, and standing up to
Riley with her little fists clenched.</p>

<p>"If the divil didn't put ye out when he gave up housekeeping, I dunno
where you come from," Riley muttered as he turned away and stumped off
stolidly.</p>

<p>During the night the horse died, and Beth found when she went out next
day that the carcass had been dragged down Murphy's garden and put in
the lane outside. She climbed the wall, and discovered the farrier
skinning the horse, and was much disgusted to see him using his hands
without gloves on in such an operation. Her anger of the day before was
all over now, and she was ready to be on the usual terms of scornful
intimacy with Murphy.</p>

<p>"Ye'll never be able to touch anything to eat again with those hands,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Won't I, thin!" he answered sulkily, and without looking up. He was as
inconsequent as a child that resents an injury, but can be diverted from
the recollection of it by anything interesting, only to return to its
grievance, however, the moment the interest fails. "Won't I, thin! Just
you try me wid a bit o' bread-an'-butter this instant, an' see what I'll
do wid it."</p>

<p>Beth, always anxious to experiment, tore indoors to get some
bread-and-butter, and never did she forget the horror with which she
watched the dirty man eat it, with unwashed hands, sitting on the
horse's carcass.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>That carcass was a source of interest to her for many a long day to
come. She used to climb on the wall to see how it was getting on, till
the crows had picked the bones clean, and the weather had bleached them
white; and she would wonder how a creature once so full of life could
become a silent, senseless thing, not feeling, not caring, not knowing,
no more to itself than a stone&mdash;strange mystery; and some day <i>she</i>
would be like that, just white bones. She held her breath and suspended
all sensation and thought, time after time, to see what it felt like;
but always immediately there began a great rushing sound in her ears as
of a terrific storm, and that, she concluded, was death coming. When he
arrived then all would be blotted out.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The country was in a very disturbed state, and it was impossible to keep
all hints of danger from the children's sharp ears. Beth knew a great
deal of what was going on and what might be expected, but then a few
chance phrases were already enough for her to construct a whole story
upon, and with wonderful accuracy generally. Her fine faculty of
observation developed apace at this time, and nothing she noticed now
was ever forgotten. She would curl up in the window-seat among the
fuchsias, and watch the people in the street by the hour together,
especially on Sundays and market-days, when a great many came in from
the mountains, women in close white caps with goffered frills, short
petticoats, and long blue cloaks; and men in tail-coats and
knee-breeches, with shillalahs under their arms, which they used very
dexterously. They talked Irish at the top of their voices, and
gesticulated a great deal, and were childishly quarrelsome. One
market-day, when Beth was looking out of the sitting-room window, her
mother came and looked out too, and they saw half-a-dozen countrymen set
upon a young Castletownrock man. In a moment their shillalahs were
whirling about his head, and he was driven round the corner of the
house. Presently he came staggering back across the road, blubbering
like a child, with his head broken, and the blood streaming down over
his face, which was white and distorted with pain. They had knocked him
down, and kicked him when he was on the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh! the cowards! the cowards!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed. Beth felt sick,
but it was not so much what she saw as what she heard that affected
her&mdash;the man's crying, and the graphic description of the nature and
depth of the wound which another man, who had been present while the
doctor dressed it, stopping at the window, kindly insisted on giving
them, Mrs. Caldwell being obliged to listen courteously for fear of
making herself unpopular. The man's manner impressed Beth&mdash;there

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> was
such a solemn joy in it, as of one who had just witnessed something
refreshing.</p>

<p>There were two priests in the place, Father Madden and Father John.
Captain Caldwell said Father Madden was a gentleman. He shook hands with
everybody, even with the curate and Mr. Macbean; but Father John would
not speak to a protestant, and used to scowl at the children when he met
them, and then Mildred would seize Bernadine's hand and drag her past
him quickly, because she hated to be scowled at; but Beth always stopped
and made a face at him. He used to carry a long whip, and crack it at
the people, and on Sunday mornings, if they did not go to mass, he would
patrol the streets in a fury, rating the idlers at the top of his voice,
and driving them on before him. Beth used to glance stealthily at the
chapel as she went to church; it had the attraction of forbidden fruit
for her, and of Father John's exciting antics&mdash;nothing ever happened in
church. Chapel she associated with the papists, and not at all with
Kitty, whose tender teaching occupied a separate compartment of her
consciousness altogether. There she kept the "Blessed Mother" and the
"Dear Lord" for her comfort, although she seldom visited them now. Terms
of endearment meant a great deal to Beth, because no one used them
habitually in her family; in fact, she could not remember ever being
called dear in her life by either father or mother.</p>

<p>Since the day when she had run away from the great green waves, however,
her father had taken an interest in her. He often asked her to brush his
hair, and laughed very much sometimes at things she said. He used to lie
on the couch reading to himself while she brushed.</p>

<p>"Read some to me, papa," she said one day. He smiled and read a little,
not in the least expecting her to understand it, but she soon showed him
that she did, and entreated him to go on; so he gradually fell into the
habit of reading aloud to her, particularly the "Ingoldsby Legends." She
liked to hear them again and again, and would clamour for her
favourites. On one occasion when he had stopped, and she had been
sitting some time at the foot of the couch, with the brush in her hand,
she suddenly burst out with a long passage from "The Execution"&mdash;the
passage that begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God! 'tis a fearsome thing to see<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That pale wan man's mute agony."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Captain Caldwell raised his eyebrows as she proceeded, and looked at his
wife.</p>

<p>"I thought a friend of ours was considered stupid," he said.</p>

<p>"People can do very well when they like," Mrs. Caldwell

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> answered
tartly; "but they're too lazy to try. When did you learn that, Beth?"</p>

<p>"I didn't learn it," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Then how do you know it?"</p>

<p>"It just came to me," Beth said.</p>

<p>"Then I wish your lessons would <i>just come</i> to you."</p>

<p>"I wish they would," said Beth sincerely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell snapped out something about idleness and obstinacy, and
left the room. The day was darkening down, and presently Captain
Caldwell got up, lit a lamp at the sideboard, and set it on the
dining-table. When he had done so, he took Beth, and set her on the
table too. Beth stood up on it, laughing, and put her arm round his
neck.</p>

<p>"Look at us, papa!" she exclaimed, pointing at the window opposite. The
blinds were up, and it was dark enough outside for them to see
themselves reflected in the glass.</p>

<p>"I think we make a pretty picture, Beth," her father said, putting his
arm round her.</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken, when there came a terrific report and a crash;
something whizzed close to Beth's head; and a shower of glass fell on
the floor. In a moment Beth had wriggled out of her father's arm, slid
from the table, and scrambled up on to the window-seat, scattering the
flower-pots, and slapping at her father's hand in her excitement, when
he tried to stop her.</p>

<p>"It's Bap-faced Flanagan&mdash;or Tony-kill-the-cow," she cried. "I can
see&mdash;O papa! why did you pull me back? Now I shall never know!"</p>

<p>The servants had rushed in from the kitchen, and Mrs. Caldwell came
flying downstairs.</p>

<p>"What is it, Henry?" she cried.</p>

<p>"The d&mdash;&mdash;d scoundrels shot at me with the child in my arms," he
answered, looking in his indignation singularly like Beth herself in a
stormy mood. As he spoke he turned to the hall door, and walked out into
the street bareheaded.</p>

<p>"For the love of the Lord, sir," Riley remonstrated, keeping well out of
the way himself.</p>

<p>But Captain Caldwell walked off down the middle of the road alone
deliberately to the police station, his wife standing meanwhile on the
doorstep, with the light behind her, coolly awaiting his return.</p>

<p>"Pull down the blind in the sitting-room, Riley, and keep Miss Beth
there," was all she said.</p>

<p>Presently Captain Caldwell returned with a police-officer and two men.
They immediately began to search the room. The glass of a picture had
been shattered at the far end. Riley pulled the picture to one side, and
discovered something imbedded in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
 the wall behind, which he picked out
with his pocket-knife and brought to the light. It looked like a disc
all bent out of shape. He turned it every way, examining it, then tried
it with his teeth.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he said significantly. "It wouldn't be yer honour they'd
be afther wid a silver bullet. I heard her tell 'em herself to try one."</p>

<p>"And I said if they missed they'd be damned," Beth exclaimed
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Beth!" cried her mother, seizing her by the arm to shake her, "how dare
you use such a word?"</p>

<p>"I heard it in church," said Beth, in an injured tone.</p>

<p>"Look here, Beth," said her father, rescuing her from her mother's
clutches, and setting her on the table&mdash;he had been talking aside with
the police officer&mdash;"I want you to promise something on your word of
honour as a lady, just to please me."</p>

<p>Beth's countenance dropped: "O papa!" she exclaimed, "it's something I
don't want to promise."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind that, Beth," he answered. "Just promise this one thing
to please me. If you don't, the people will try and kill you."</p>

<p>"I don't mind that," said Beth.</p>

<p>"But I do&mdash;and your mother does."</p>

<p>Beth gave her mother a look of such utter astonishment, that the poor
lady turned crimson.</p>

<p>"And perhaps they'll kill me too," Captain Caldwell resumed. "You see
they nearly did to-night."</p>

<p>This was a veritable inspiration. Beth turned pale, and gasped: "I
promise!"</p>

<p>"Not so fast," her father said. "Never promise anything till you hear
what it is. But now, promise you won't say bad luck to any of the people
again."</p>

<p>"I promise," Beth repeated; "but"&mdash;she slid from the table, and nodded
emphatically&mdash;"but when I shake my fist and stamp my foot at them it'll
mean the same thing."</p>

<p>It was found next morning that Bap-faced Flanagan and Tony-kill-the-cow
had disappeared from the township; but Murphy remained; and Beth was not
allowed to go out alone again for a long time, not even into the garden.
All she knew about it herself, however, was, that she had always either
a policeman or a coastguardsman to talk to, which added very much to her
pleasure in life, and also to Anne's.

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span>
 of the interests of Captain Caldwell's life was his garden. He spent
long hours in cultivating it, and that summer his vegetables, fruits,
and flowers had been the wonder of the neighbourhood. But now autumn had
come, vegetables were dug, fruits gathered, flowers bedraggled; and
there was little to be done but clear the beds, plant them with bulbs,
and prepare them for the spring.</p>

<p>Now that Captain Caldwell had made Beth's acquaintance, he liked to have
her with him to help him when he was at work in the garden, and there
was nothing that she loved so much.</p>

<p>One day they were at work together on a large flower-bed. Her father was
trimming some rose-bushes, and she was kneeling beside him on a little
mat, weeding.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I'm not a flower," she suddenly exclaimed, after a long
silence.</p>

<p>"Why, Beth, flowers are very beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they last so short a time. I'd rather be less beautiful, and
live longer. What's your favourite flower, papa?"</p>

<p>She had stopped weeding for the moment, but still sat on the mat,
looking up at him. Captain Caldwell clipped a little more, then stopped
too, and looked down at her.</p>

<p>"I don't get a separate pleasure from any particular flower, Beth; they
all delight me," he answered.</p>

<p>Beth pondered upon this for a little, then she asked, "Do you know which
I like best? Hot primroses." Captain Caldwell raised his eyebrows
interrogatively. "When you pick them in the sun, and put them against
your cheek, they're all warm, you know," Beth explained; "and then they
<i>are</i> good! And fuchsias are good too, but it isn't the same good. You
know that one in the sitting-room window, white outside and
salmon-coloured inside, and such a nice shape&mdash;the flowers&mdash;and the way
they hang down; you have to lift them to look into them. When I look at
them long, they make me feel&mdash;oh&mdash;feel, you know&mdash;feel that I could take
the whole plant in my arms and hug it. But fuchsias don't scent sweet
like hot primroses."</p>

<p>"And therefore they are not so good?" her father suggested, greatly
interested in the child's attempt to express herself. "They say that the
scent is the soul of the flower."</p>

<p>"The scent is the soul of the flower," Beth repeated several times; then
heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction. "I want to sing it," she said. "I
always want to sing things like that."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"What other 'things like that' do you know, Beth?"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;"The song of the sea in the shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The swish of the grass in the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sound of a far-away bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The whispering leaves on the trees,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beth burst out instantly.</p>

<p>"Who taught you that, Beth?" her father asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no one taught me, papa," she answered. "It just came to me&mdash;like
this, you know. I used to listen to the sea in that shell in the
sitting-room, and I tried and tried to find a name for the sound, and
all at once <i>song</i> came into my head&mdash;<i>The song of the sea in the
shell</i>. Then I was lying out here on the grass when it was long, before
you cut it to make hay, and you came out and said, 'There's a stiff
breeze blowing.' And it blew hard and then stopped, and then it came
again; and every time it came the grass went&mdash;swish-h-h! <i>The swish of
the grass in the breeze.</i> Then you know that bell that rings a long way
off, you can only just hear it out here&mdash;<i>The sound of a far-away bell</i>.
Then the leaves&mdash;it <i>was</i> a long time before anything came that I could
sing about them. I used to try and think it, but you can't sing a thing
you think. It's when a thing comes, you can sing it. I was always
listening to the leaves, and I always felt they were doing something;
then all at once it came one day. Of course they were whispering&mdash;<i>The
whispering leaves on the trees</i>. That was how they came, papa. At first
I used to sing them by themselves; but now I sing them all together. You
can sing them three different ways&mdash;the way I did first, you know, then
you can put <i>breeze</i> first&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The swish of the grass in the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whispering leaves on the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song of the sea in the shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of a far-away bell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or you can sing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sound of a far-away bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The whispering leaves on the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The swish of the grass in the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song of the sea in the shell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which way do you think the nicest?" She had rattled all this off as fast
as she could speak, looking and pointing towards the various things she
mentioned as she proceeded, the sea, the grass, the trees, the distance;
now she looked up to her father for an answer. He was looking at her so
queerly, she was filled with alarm. "Am I naughty, papa?" she
exclaimed.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh no," he said, with a smile that reassured her. "I was just thinking.
I like to hear how 'things come' to you. You must always tell me&mdash;when
new things come. By the way, who told you that fuchsia was
salmon-coloured?"</p>

<p>"I <i>saw</i> it was," she said, surprised that he needed to ask such a
question. "I saw it one day when we had boiled salmon for dinner. Isn't
it nice when you see that one thing's like another? I have a pebble, and
it's just the shape of a pear&mdash;now you know what shape it is, don't
you?" He nodded. "But if I said it's thick at one end and thin at
another, you wouldn't know what shape it is a bit, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, I should not," he answered, beginning to prune again, thoughtfully.
"Beth," he said presently, "I should like to see you grow up."</p>

<p>"Shan't I grow up?" said Beth in dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;at least I should hope so. But&mdash;it's not likely that <i>I</i> shall
be&mdash;looking on. But, Beth, I want you to remember this. When you grow
up, I think you will want to do something that only a few other people
can do well&mdash;paint a picture, write a book, act in a theatre, make
music&mdash;it doesn't matter what; if it comes to you, if you feel you can
do it, just do it. You'll not do it well all at once; but try and try
until you <i>can</i> do it well. And don't ask anybody if they think you can
do it; they'll be sure to say no; and then you'll be
disheartened&mdash;What's disheartened? It's the miserable feeling you would
get if I said you would never be able to learn to play the piano. You'd
try to do it all the same, perhaps, but you'd do it doubtfully instead
of with confidence."</p>

<p>"What's confidence?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"You are listening to me now with confidence. It is as if you said, I
believe you."</p>

<p>"But I can't say 'I believe you' to arithmetic, if I want to do it."</p>

<p>"No, but you can say, I believe I can do it&mdash;I believe in myself."</p>

<p>"Is that confidence in myself?" Beth asked, light breaking in upon her.</p>

<p>"That's it. You're getting quite a vocabulary, Beth. A vocabulary is all
the words you know," he added hastily, anticipating the inevitable
question.</p>

<p>Beth went on with her weeding for a little.</p>

<p>"And there is another thing, Beth, I want to tell you," her father
recommenced. "Never do anything unless you are quite sure it is the
right thing to do. It doesn't matter how much you may want to do it, you
mustn't, if you are not quite, quite sure it is right."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not even if I am just half sure?"</p>

<p>"No, certainly not. You must be quite, quite sure."</p>

<p>Beth picked some more weeds, then looked up at him again: "But, papa, I
shall never want to do anything I don't think right when I'm grown up,
shall I?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will. Everybody does."</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> want to, papa?" Beth asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"And did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he repeated.</p>

<p>"And what happened?"</p>

<p>"Much misery."</p>

<p>"Were you miserable?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very. But that wasn't the worst of it."</p>

<p>"What was the worst of it?"</p>

<p>"The worst of it was that I made other people miserable."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's bad," said Beth, with perfect comprehension. "That makes you
feel so horrid inside yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, Beth, just you remember that. You can't do wrong without making
somebody else miserable. Be loyal, be loyal to yourself, loyal to the
best that is in you; that means, be as good as your friends think you,
and better if you can. Tell the truth, live openly, and stick to your
friends; that's the whole of the best code of morality in the world. Now
we must go in."</p>

<p>As they walked down the garden together, Beth slipped her dirty little
hand into his, and looked up at him: "Papa," she said solemnly, "when
you want to be with somebody always, more than with anybody else; and
want to look at him, and want to talk to him, and you find you can tell
him lots of things you couldn't tell anybody else if you tried, you
know; what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means you love him very much."</p>

<p>"Then I love you, papa, very much," she said, nestling her head against
his arm. "And it does make me feel so nice inside. But it makes me
miserable too," she added, sighing.</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"When you have a headache, you know. I used only to be afraid you'd be
angry if I made a noise. But now I'm always thinking how much it hurts
you. I wake up often and often at night, and you are in my mind, and I
try and see you say, 'It's better,' or 'It's quite well.'"</p>

<p>"And what then, Beth?" her father asked, in a queer voice.</p>

<p>"Then I don't cry any more, you know."</p>

<p>She looked up at her father as she spoke, and saw that his eyes were
full of tears.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> was almost the last of those happy autumn days. Winter fell upon
the country suddenly with nipping cold. The mountains, always sombre,
lowered in great tumbled masses from under the heavy clouds that seldom
rose from their summits. Terrible gales kept the sea in torment, and the
voice of its rage and pain filled Castletownrock without ceasing.
Torrents of rain tore up the roads, and rendered them almost impassable.
There was stolid endurance and suffering written on every face out of
doors, while within the people cowered over their peat fires, a prey to
hunger, cold, and depression. Draughts made merry through the large
rooms and passages in Captain Caldwell's house; the wind howled in the
chimneys, rattled at the windows, and whistled at the keyholes,
especially at night, when Beth would hide her head under the bed-clothes
to keep out the racket, or, in another mood, lie and listen to it, and
imagine herself out in the storm, till her nerves were strung to a state
of ecstatic tension, and her mind fairly revelled in the sense of
danger. When her father was at home in the evening, she would sit still
beside the fire in the sitting-room, listening in breathless awe, and
excitement wholly pleasurable, to the gale raging without; but if
Captain Caldwell had not returned, as frequently happened now that the
days were short, and the roads so bad, well knowing the risks he ran,
she would see the car upset a hundred times, and hear the rattle of
musketry in every blast that shook the house, and so share silently, but
to the full, the terrible anxiety which kept her mother pacing up and
down, up and down, unable to settle to anything until he entered and
sank into a seat, often so exhausted that it was hard to rouse him to
change his dripping clothes. His duties, always honourably performed
whatever the risk to himself, were far too severe for him, and he was
rapidly becoming a wreck;&mdash;nervous, liverish, a martyr to headache, and
a slave to stimulants, although not a drunkard&mdash;he only took enough to
whip him up to his work. His digestion too had become seriously
impaired, and he had no natural appetite for anything. He was fond of
his children, and proud of them, but had hitherto been too irritable to
contribute anything to their happiness; on the contrary, his name was a
terror to them, and "Hush, papa has come in!" was enough at any time to
damp their wildest spirits. Now, however, he suffered more from
depression than from irritability, and would cower over the fire on
stormy days in a state of despondency which was reflected

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>in every
face, taking no notice of any of them. The children would watch him
furtively in close silent sympathy, sitting still and whispering for
fear of disturbing him; and if perchance they saw him smile, and a look
of relief came into their mother's anxious face, their own spirits went
up on the instant. But everything was against him. The damp came up from
the flags in the sitting-room through the cocoanut matting and the thick
carpet that covered it, which it defaced in great patches. Close to the
fire the wires of the piano rusted, and had to be rubbed and rubbed
every day, or half the notes went dumb. The paper, a rare luxury in
those parts, began to drop from the walls. Great turf-fires were
constantly kept up, but the damp stole a march on them when they
smouldered in the night, and made mildew-marks upon everything.</p>

<p>Good food and cooking would have helped Captain Caldwell, but the food
was indifferent, and there were no cooks to be had in the country. Biddy
had never seen such a thing as a kitchen-range before she took the
situation, and when she first had to use the oven, she put the turf on
the bottom shelf in order to heat the top one. Mrs. Caldwell made what
were superhuman efforts to a woman of her training and constitution, to
keep the servants up to the mark, and grew grey in the endeavour; but
Mrs. Caldwell in the kitchen was like a racehorse at the plough; and
even if she had been a born housewife, she could have done little with
servants who would do nothing themselves except under her eyes, and
stole everything they could lay their hands on, including the salt out
of the salt-cellars between meals, if it were not locked up.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January, Captain Caldwell was ill in bed; he had wet
cloths on his head, and seemed as if he could hardly speak. Beth hung
about his door all day, watching for opportunities to steal in. Mamma
always sent her away if she could, but if papa heard her, he would
whisper, "Let the child come in," and then mamma would let her in, but
would still look cross. And Beth sat at one side of the bed, and mamma
sat on the other, and no one spoke except papa sometimes; only you could
seldom understand what he said. And mamma cried, but Beth did not. She
ached too much inside for that. You can't cry when you ache so much.</p>

<p>Beth day after day sat with her hands folded on her lap, and her feet
dangling from a chair that was much too high for her, watching her
father with an intensity of silent anxiety that was terrible to witness
in so young a child. Her mother might have beaten her to death, but she
could never have dislodged her from the room once she had her father's
leave to stay there. Mrs. Caldwell rarely beat her now, however; she
generally ignored her; so Beth came and went as she chose. She would
climb up

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
 on to the bed when there was nobody in the room, and kiss the
curls of papa's thick glossy black hair so softly that he never knew,
except once, when he caught her, and smiled. His dark face grew grey in
bed, and his blue eyes sunken and haggard; but he battled it out that
time, and slowly began to recover.</p>

<p>Beth was sitting in her usual place beside her father's bed one day when
the doctor came and discovered her. He was standing on the other side of
the bed, and exclaimed, "Why, it's all eyes!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a queer pixie," her father said. "But it's going to do
something some day, or <i>I'm</i> much mistaken."</p>

<p>"It's going to make a nuisance of itself if you put such nonsense into
its head, or I'm much mistaken," Mrs. Caldwell observed.</p>

<p>"I shall <i>not</i> make a nuisance of myself," Beth indignantly protested.</p>

<p>"I shall never be able to make you understand, Caroline," Captain
Caldwell exclaimed. "Little pitchers are generally bad enough, but when
there is large intelligence added to the long ears, they're the devil."</p>

<p>Before the doctor left he said to Mrs. Caldwell, "We must keep our
patient amused, you know."</p>

<p>"O doctor!" Beth exclaimed, clasping her hands in her earnestness, "do
you think if Sophie Keene came?"</p>

<p>The doctor burst into a shout of laughter, in which Captain Caldwell
also joined. "Just stay here yourself, Beth," he said, when he had
recovered himself. "For amusement, neither Sophie Keene nor any one else
I ever knew could hold a candle to you."</p>

<p>"What's 'hold a candle to you'?" Beth instantly demanded.</p>

<p>And then there was more laughter, in which even Mrs. Caldwell joined;
and afterwards, when the doctor had gone, she actually patted Beth on
the back, and stroked her hair, which was the first caress Beth ever
remembered to have received from her mother.</p>

<p>"Now, mamma," she exclaimed, with great feeling, in the fulness of her
surprise and delight, "now I shall forget that you ever beat me."</p>

<p>Her mother coloured painfully.</p>

<p>Her father muttered something about a noble nature.</p>

<p>"And that was the child you never wanted at all!" slipped, with a ring
of triumph, from Mrs. Caldwell unawares&mdash;an interesting example of the
complexity of human feelings.</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell soon went back to his duty&mdash;all too soon for his
strength. The dreadful weather continued. Day after day he returned
soaking from some distant station to the damp and discomfort of the
house, and the ill-cooked, unappetising food,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> which he could hardly
swallow. And to all this was added great anxiety about the future of his
family. His boys were doing well at school by this time; but he was not
satisfied with the way in which the little girls were being brought up.
There was no order in their lives, no special time for anything; and he
knew the importance of early discipline. He tried to discuss the subject
with his wife, but she met his suggestions irritably.</p>

<p>"There's time enough for that," she said. "<i>I</i> had no regular lessons
till I was in my teens."</p>

<p>"But what answered with you may be disastrous to these children," he
ventured. "They are all unlike you in disposition, more especially
Beth."</p>

<p>"You spoil that child," Mrs. Caldwell protested. "And at any rate I can
do no more. I am run off my feet."</p>

<p>This was true, and Captain Caldwell let the subject drop. His patience
was exemplary in those days. He suffered severely both mentally and
physically, but never complained. The shadow was upon him, and he knew
it, but he met his fate with fortitude. Whatever his faults, they were
expiated in the estimation of all who saw him suffer now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell never realised how ill he was, but still she was uneasy,
and it was with intense relief that she welcomed a case of soups and
other nourishing delicacies calculated to tempt the appetite, which
arrived for him one day from one of his sisters in England.</p>

<p>"This is just what you want, Henry," she said, with a brighter look in
her face than he had seen there for months. "I shall soon have you
yourself again now."</p>

<p>Captain Caldwell's spirits also went up.</p>

<p>In the evening they were all together in the sitting-room. Mrs. Caldwell
was playing little songs for Mildred to sing, Baby Bernadine was playing
with her bricks upon the floor, and Beth as usual was hanging about her
father. He had shaken off his despondency, and was quite lively for the
moment, walking up and down the room, and making merry remarks to his
wife in Italian, at which she laughed a good deal.</p>

<p>"Come, Beth, fetch 'Ingoldsby.' We shall just come to my favourite, and
finish the book before you go to bed," he said.</p>

<p>Beth brought the book, and then climbed up on his knee, and settled
there happily, with her head on his shoulder.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As I laye a-thynkynge, the golden sun was sinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;O merrie sang that Bird as it glitter'd on her breast,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">While soaring to the skies,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">'Twas so she seemed to saye,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">'HERE IS REST!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After he had read those last lines, there was a moment's silence, and
then Beth burst into a tempest of tears. "O papa&mdash;papa! No, no, no!" she
sobbed. "I couldn't bear it."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter with the child?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed, starting
up.</p>

<p>"'The vision and the faculty divine,' I think," her father answered.
"Leave her to me."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Beth was awake when Anne entered the nursery next morning to call the
children.</p>

<p>"Get up, and be good," Anne said. "Your pa's ill."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell came into the nursery immediately afterwards, very much
agitated. She kissed Beth, and from that moment the child was calm; but
there settled upon her pathetic little face a terrible look of age and
anxiety.</p>

<p>When she was dressed, she ran right into her father's room before any
one could stop her. He was moaning&mdash;"O my head, my head! O my head, my
head!" over and over again.</p>

<p>"You mustn't stay here, little woman&mdash;not to-day," the doctor said. "It
will make your father worse if you do."</p>

<p>Beth stole from the room, and returned to the nursery. There, however,
she could still hear her father moaning, and she could not bear it, so
she took her prayer-book, by way of life-saving apparatus, and went down
to the kitchen to "see" what the servants were thinking&mdash;her own
significant expression. They were all strangely subdued. "Sit down, Miss
Beth," Biddy said kindly. "Sit down in the window there wid your book if
you want company. It's a sore heart you'll be having, or I'm much
mistaken."</p>

<p>Beth sat in the window the whole morning, reading prayers to herself,
while she watched and waited. The doctor sent Riley down from the
sick-room several times to fetch things, and each time Beth consulted
his countenance anxiously for news, but asked no questions. Biddy tried
to persuade her to eat, but the child could not touch anything.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Riley came down in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Is the master better, Pat?" Biddy demanded.</p>

<p>"'Deed, thin, he isn't," Riley replied; "and the doctor's sending me off
on the horse as hard as I can go for Dr. Jamieson."</p>

<p>"Och, thin, if the doctor's sending you for Dr. Jamieson it's all up.
He's niver sent for till the last. The Lord himself won't save him
now."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth shuffled over the leaves of her prayer-book hurriedly. She had been
crying piteously to God in her heart for hours to save her father, and
He had not heard; now she remembered that the servants said if you read
the Lord's Prayer backwards it would raise the devil. Beth tried; but
the invocation was unavailing. Before Riley could saddle the horse, a
message was sent down to stop him; and then Anne came for Beth, and took
her up to her father's room. The dreadful sounds had ceased at last, and
there was a strange silence in the house. Mrs. Caldwell was sitting
beside her husband's bed, rocking herself a little as if in pain, but
shedding no tears. Mildred was standing with her arm round her mother's
neck crying bitterly, while Baby Bernadine gazed at her father
wonderingly.</p>

<p>He was lying on his side with his arms folded. His eyes were shut, and
there was a lovely look of relief upon his face.</p>

<p>"I sent for you children," their mother said, "to see your father just
as he died. You must never forget him."</p>

<p>Ellis and Rickards, two of papa's men, were in the room, and Mrs. Ellis
too, and the doctor, and Riley, and Biddy, and Anne; and there was a
foot-bath, with steaming hot water in it, on the floor; some mustard on
the table; and the fire burnt brightly. These details impressed
themselves on Beth's mind involuntarily, as indeed did everything else
connected with that time. It seemed to her afterwards as if she had seen
everything and felt nothing for the moment&mdash;nothing but breathless
excitement and interest. Her grief was entirely suspended.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellis and the doctor led mamma down to the sitting-room; they
didn't seem to think that she could walk. And then Mrs. Ellis made her
some tea, and stood there, and coaxed her to drink it, just as if mamma
had been a child. Mrs. Caldwell sat on the big couch with her back to
the window, and Mildred sat beside her, with her arm round her, crying
all the time. Bernadine cried too, but it was because she was hungry,
and no one thought of giving her anything to eat. Beth fetched her some
bread-and-butter, and then she was good. People began to arrive&mdash;Mr.
Macbean, Captain and Mrs. Keene, the Smalls, the curate&mdash;Father Madden
even. He had heard the news out in the country, and came hurrying back
to pay his respects, and offer his condolences to Mrs. Caldwell, and see
if there was anything he could do. He hoped it was not taking a liberty
to come; but indeed he came in the fulness of his heart, and because he
couldn't help it, for he had known him well, and a better man and truer
gentleman never breathed. The widow held out her hand to the priest, and
looked up at him gratefully.</p>

<p>Beth opened the door for Mrs. Small, who exclaimed at once:

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> "Oh, my
dear child, how is your poor mother? Does she cry at all? I do hope she
has been crying."</p>

<p>"No," Beth answered, "nobody cries but Mildred."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Small went in, Mrs. Caldwell spoke to her quite collectedly.
"He was taken ill at eight o'clock this morning with a dreadful pain in
his head," she told her. "He had suffered fearfully from his head of
late. I sent for the doctor at once. But nothing relieved him. From ten
o'clock he got worse and worse, and at four he was gone. He always
wished to die suddenly, and be spared a lingering illness. He has been
depressed of late, but this morning, early, he woke up quite brightly;
and last night he was wonderfully better. After the children had gone to
bed, he read aloud to me as he used to do in the old days; and he looked
so much more like his old self again that I thought a happier time was
coming. And so it was. But not for me."</p>

<p>"Poor lady!" Mrs. Small whispered. "It has been a fearful shock."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell showed strength of character in the midst of the
overwhelming calamity which had fallen upon her with such awful
suddenness. She had a nice sense of honour, and her love was great; and
by the help of these she was enabled to carry out every wish of her dead
husband with regard to himself. He had had a fastidious horror of being
handled after death by the kind of old women who are accustomed to lay
out bodies, and therefore Mrs. Caldwell begged Ellis and Rickards to
perform that last duty for him themselves.</p>

<p>When the children went to bed, she took them to kiss their father. The
stillness of the chamber struck a chill through Beth, but she thought it
beautiful. The men had draped it in white, and decorated it with
evergreens, there being no flowers in season. Papa was smiling, and
looked serenely happy.</p>

<p>"Years ago he was like that," mamma said softly, as if she were speaking
to herself; "but latterly there has been a look of pain. I am glad to
see him so once more. You are at peace now&mdash;dearest." She stroked his
dark hair, and as she did so her hand showed white against it.</p>

<p>The children kissed him; and then Mrs. Ellis persuaded mamma to come and
help her to put them to bed; and mamma taught them to say: "<i>Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.</i>" She told
them to remember they had learnt it on the day their father died, and
asked them to say it always in memory of him. Beth believed for a long
time that it was he who would walk with her through the valley of the
shadow, and in after years she felt sure that her mother had thought so
too.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ellis stayed all night, and slept with the children.</p>

<p>When their mother left them, Beth could not sleep. She had noticed how
cold her father was when she kissed him, and was distressed to think he
had only a sheet to cover him. The longer she thought of it, the more
wretched she became, especially when she contrasted the warmth and
softness of her own little bed with the hardness and coldness of the one
they had made up for him; and at last she could bear it no longer. She
sat up in bed and listened. She could hear by their breathing that the
other children were asleep, but she was not sure about Mrs. Ellis. Very
stealthily, therefore, she slipped out of bed, and pulled off the
clothes. She could only just clasp them in both arms, but the nursery
door was ajar, and she managed to open it with her foot. It creaked
noisily, and Beth waited, listening in suspense; but nobody moved; so
she slipped out into the passage. It was quite dark there, and the floor
felt very cold to her bare feet. She stumbled down the passage, tripping
over the bed-clothes as she went, and dreading to be caught and stopped,
but not afraid of anything else. The door was open when she reached it,
and there was a dim light in the room. This was unexpected, and she
paused to peep in before she entered. Two candles were burning on a
table at the foot of the bed. Their flames flickered in a draught, and
cast shadows on her father's face, so that it seemed as if he moved and
breathed again. Her mother was kneeling beside the bed, with her face
hidden on her husband's breast, her left arm round him, while with the
fingers of her right hand she incessantly toyed with his hair. "Only
last night," she was saying, "only last night; oh, I cannot believe
it!&mdash;perhaps I ought to be glad&mdash;there will be no more pain for you&mdash;oh,
my darling, I would have given my life to save you a moment's pain&mdash;and
I could do so little&mdash;so little. Oh, if only you could come back to tell
me that your life had ever been the better for me, that I had not spoilt
it utterly, that I brought you some happiness." She raised her head and
looked into the tranquil face. The flickering shadows flitted across it,
but did not deceive her. She must ache on always for an answer
now&mdash;always, for ever. With a convulsive sob, she crawled up closer on
her knees, and laid her cheek beside his, but no tears came. She had not
wept at all that day.</p>

<p>Beth stood for a long time in the doorway, listening to her mother's
rambling talk, and watching her white fingers straying through her
father's hair. She hugged the bed-clothes close, but she had forgotten
why she came. She felt no cold; she held no thought; her whole being was
absorbed in the scene before her.</p>

<p>Presently, however, something that her mother said aroused her&mdash;"Cold,"
she was murmuring, "so cold. How you dreaded

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> it too! You were always
delicate and suffering, yet you did more than the strongest men, for our
sakes. You never spared yourself. What you undertook to do, you did like
an honourable gentleman, neglecting nothing. You have died doing your
duty, as you wished to die. You have been dying all these months&mdash;and I
never suspected&mdash;I did not know&mdash;dying&mdash;killed by exposure&mdash;and
anxiety&mdash;and bad food. You came home hungry, and you could not eat what
I had to give you&mdash;cold, and I could not warm you&mdash;oh, the cruel, bitter
cold!"</p>

<p>Beth slipped up to her noiselessly.</p>

<p>"Mamma!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell started.</p>

<p>Beth held out the blankets&mdash;"to cover him."</p>

<p>Her mother caught her in her arms. "O my poor little child! my poor
little child!" she cried; and then at last she burst into tears.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>During the days that preceded her father's funeral, Beth did not miss
him. It was as if he were somewhere else, that was all&mdash;away in the
mountains&mdash;and was himself thinking, as Beth did continually, about the
still, cold, smiling figure that reposed, serenely indifferent to them
all, in his room upstairs. One day, what he had said about being laid
out by old women came into her head, and she wondered what he would have
looked like when they laid him out that he should have objected so
strongly to their seeing him. She was near the death-chamber at the
moment, and went in. No one was there, and she stood a long time looking
at the figure on the bed. It was entirely covered, but she had only to
lift the sheet and learn the secret. She turned it back from the placid
face, then stopped, and whispered half in awe, half in interrogation,
"Papa!" As she pronounced the word, the inhuman impulse passed and was
forgotten.</p>

<p>Hours later, Mrs. Ellis found her sitting beside him as she had so often
done during his illness, on that same chair which was too high for her,
her feet dangling, and her little hands folded in her lap, gazing at him
with a face as placidly set, save for the eyes, as his own.</p>

<p>The next day they had all to bid him the long farewell. Mrs. Caldwell
stood looking down upon him, not wiping the great tears that welled up
painfully into her eyes, lest in the act she should blot out the dear
image and so lose sight of it for one last precious moment. She was an
undemonstrative woman, but the lingering way in which she touched him,
his hair, his face, his waxen hands, was all the more impressive for
that in its restrained tenderness.</p>

<p>Suddenly she uncovered his feet. They were white as marble,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> and
beautifully formed. "Ah, I feared so!" she exclaimed. "They put them
into hot water that day. I knew it was too hot, and I said so; he seemed
insensible, but I felt him wince&mdash;and see!" The scar of a scald proved
that she had been right. This last act, due to the fear that he had been
made to suffer an unnecessary pang, struck Beth in after years as
singularly pathetic.</p>

<p>It was not until after the funeral that Beth herself realised that she
had lost her father. When they returned, the house had been set in
order, and made to look as usual&mdash;yet something was missing. The blinds
were up, the sun was streaming in, the "Ingoldsby Legends" lay on the
sofa in the sitting-room. When Beth saw the book her eyes dilated with a
pang. It lay there, just as he had left it; but he was in the ground. He
would never come back again.</p>

<p>Suddenly the child threw herself on the floor in an agony of grief,
sobbing, moaning, writhing, tearing her hair, and calling aloud, "Papa!
papa! Come back! come back! come back!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell in her fright would have tried her old remedy of shaking
and beating; but Mrs. Ellis snatched the child up and carried her off to
the nursery, where she kept her for the rest of that terrible day,
rocking her on her knee most of the time, and talking to her about her
father in heaven, living the life eternal, yet watching over her still,
and waiting for her, until she fired Beth's imagination, and the
terrible grave was forgotten.</p>

<p>That night, however, and for many nights to come, the child started up
out of her sleep, and wept, and wailed, and tore her hair, and had again
to be nursed and comforted.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span>
 like the mountains, all jumbled up together when you view them from
a distance, had Beth's impulses and emotions already begun to be in
their extraordinary complexity at this period; and even more like the
mountains when you are close to them, for then, losing sight of the
whole, you become aware of the details, and are surprised at their
wonderful diversity, at the heights and hollows, the barren wastes,
fertile valleys, gentle slopes, and giddy precipices&mdash;heights and
hollows of hope and despair, barren wastes of mis-spent time, fertile
valleys of intellectual accomplishment, gentle slopes of aspiration
undefined, and giddy precipices of passionate impulse and desperate
revolt. Genius is sympathetic insight made perfect; and it must have
this diversity if it is ever to be effectual&mdash;must touch on every human
experience,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
 must suffer, and must also enjoy; great, therefore, are its
compensations. It feels the sorrows of all mankind, and is elevated by
them; whereas the pain of an individual bereavement is rather acute than
prolonged. Genius is spared the continuous gnawing ache of the grief
which stultifies; instead of an ever-present wearing sense of loss that
would dim its power, it retains only those hallowed memories, those
vivid recollections, which foster the joy of a great yearning
tenderness; and all its pains are transmuted into something subtle,
mysterious, invisible, neither to be named nor ignored&mdash;a fertilising
essence which is the source of its own heaven, and may also contain the
salvation of earth. So genius has no lasting griefs.</p>

<p>Beth utterly rejected all thought of her father in his grave, and even
of her father in heaven. When her first wild grief subsided, he returned
to her, to be with her, as those we love are with us always in their
absence, enshrined in our happy consciousness. She never mentioned him
in these days, but his presence, warm in her heart, kept her little
being aglow; and it was only when people spoke to her, and distracted
her attention from the thought of him, that she felt disconsolate. While
she could walk with him in dreams, she cared for no other companionship.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful position for poor Mrs. Caldwell, left a widow&mdash;not
without friends, certainly, for the people were kind&mdash;but with none of
her own kith and kin, in that wild district, embarrassed for want of
money, and broken in health. But, as is usual in times of great
calamity, many things happened, showing both the best and the worst side
of human nature.</p>

<p>After Captain Caldwell's death, old Captain Keene, who had once held the
appointment himself, and was indebted to Captain Caldwell for much
kindly hospitality, went about the countryside telling people that
Captain Caldwell had died of drink. Some officious person immediately
brought the story to Mrs. Caldwell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell had the house on her hands, but the officer who was sent
to succeed Captain Caldwell would be obliged to take it, as there was no
other. He arrived one day with a very fastidious wife, who did not like
the house at all. There was no accommodation in it, no china cupboard,
nothing fit for a lady. She must have it all altered. From the way she
spoke, it seemed to Beth that she blamed her mother for everything that
was wrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell said very little. She was suffering from a great swelling
at the back of her neck&mdash;an anthrax, the doctor called it&mdash;and was not
fit to be about at all, but her indomitable fortitude kept her up. Mrs.
Ellis had stayed to nurse her, and help with the children. She and Mrs.
Caldwell looked at each other and smiled when the new officer's wife had
gone.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's a very fine lady indeed, Mrs. Ellis," Mrs. Caldwell said, sighing
wearily.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," Mrs. Ellis answered; "but people who have been used to
things all their lives think less about them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellis was very kind to the children, and when wet days kept Beth
indoors, she would stay with her, and study her with interest. She was
thin, precise, low-voiced, quiet in her movements, passionless, loyal;
and every time she took a mouthful at table, she wiped her mouth.</p>

<p>The doctor came every day to dress the abscess on Mrs. Caldwell's neck,
and every day he said that if it had not burst of itself he should have
been obliged to make a deep incision in it in the form of a cross.
Mildred and Beth were always present on these occasions, fighting to be
allowed to hold the basin. Mrs. Ellis wanted to turn them out, but Mrs.
Caldwell said: "Let them stay, poor little bodies; they like to be with
me."</p>

<p>The poor lady, ill as she was, had neither peace nor quiet. The yard was
full of great stones now, and stone-masons hammered at them from early
morning till late at night, chipping them into shape for the alterations
and additions to be made to the house; the loft was full of carpenters
preparing boards for flooring; the yard-gates were always open, and
people came and went as they liked, so that there was no more privacy
for the family. Mildred stayed indoors with her mother a good deal; but
Beth, followed by Bernadine, who had become her shadow, was continually
in the yard among the men, listening, questioning, and observing. To
Beth, at this time, the grown-up people of her race were creatures with
a natural history other than her own, which she studied with great
intelligence and interest, and sometimes also with disgust; for,
although she was so much more with the common people, as she had been
taught to call them, than with her own class, she did not adopt their
standards, and shrank always with innate refinement from everything
gross. No one thought of shooting her now. She had not only lived down
her unpopularity, but, by dint of her natural fearlessness, her cheerful
audacity of speech, and quick comprehension, had won back the fickle
hearts of the people, who weighed her words again superstitiously, and
made much of her. The workmen, with the indolent, inconsequent Irish
temperament which makes it irksome to follow up a task continuously, and
easier to do anything than the work in hand, would break off to amuse
her at any time. One young carpenter&mdash;lean, sallow, and sulky&mdash;who was
working for her mother, interested her greatly. He was making
packing-cases, and the first one was all wrong, and had to be pulled to
pieces; and the way he swore as he demolished

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> it, ripping out oaths as
he ripped up the boards, impressed Beth as singularly silly.</p>

<p>There was another carpenter at work in the loft, a little wizened old
man. He always brought a peculiar kind of yellow bread, and shared it
with the children, who loved it, and took as much as they wanted without
scruple, so that the poor old man must have had short-commons himself
sometimes. He could draw all kinds of things&mdash;fish with scales, ships in
full sail, horses, coaches, people&mdash;and Beth often made him get out his
big broad pencil and do designs for her on the new white boards. When he
was within earshot, the people in the yard were particular about what
they said before the children; if they forgot themselves he called them
to order, and silenced them instantly, which surprised Beth, because he
was the smallest man there. There was one man, however, whom the old
carpenter could never suppress. Beth did not know how this man got his
living. He came from the village to gossip, wore a tweed suit, not like
a workman's, nor was it the national Irish dress. He had a red nose and
a wooden leg, and, after she knew him, for a long time she always
expected a man with a wooden leg to have a red nose, but, somehow, she
never expected a man with a red nose to have a wooden leg. This man was
always cheery, and very voluble. He used the worst language possible in
the pleasantest way, and his impervious good-humour was proof against
all remonstrance. What he said was either blasphemous or obscene as a
rule, but in effect it was not at all like the same thing from the other
men, because, with them, such language was the expression of anger and
evil moods, while with him it was the vehicle of thought from a mind
habitually serene.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell was being hurried out of the house with indecent haste,
considering the state of her health and all the arrangements she had to
make; but she bore up bravely. She was touched one day by an offer of
help from Beth, and begged her to take charge of Bernadine and be a
little mother to her. Beth promised to do her best. Accordingly, when
Bernadine was naughty, Beth beat her, in dutiful imitation. Bernadine,
however, invariably struck back. When other interests palled, Beth would
encourage Bernadine to risk her neck by persuading her to jump down
after her from high places. She was nearly as good a jumper as Beth, the
great difference being that Beth always lit on her feet, while Bernadine
was apt to come down on her head; but it was this peculiarity that made
her attempts so interesting.</p>

<p>The yard very soon became a sociable centre for the whole idle place.
Any one who chose came into it in a friendly way, and lounged about,
gossiping, and inspecting the works in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
 progress. Women brought their
babies, and sat about on the stones suckling them and talking to the
men&mdash;a proceeding which filled Beth with disgust, she thought it so
peculiarly indelicate.</p>

<p>Beth stood with her mother at the sitting-room window one day to see the
last of poor Artless, as he was led away on a halter by a strange man,
his glossy chestnut coat showing dappled in the sunshine, but his wild
spirit much subdued for want of corn. The first time they had seen him
was on the day of their arrival, when Captain Caldwell had ridden out on
him to meet them. Mrs. Caldwell burst into tears at the recollection.</p>

<p>"He was the first evidence of promotion and prosperity," she said. "But
the promotion has been to a higher sphere, and I much fear that the
prosperity, like Artless himself, has departed for ever."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell had decided to return to her own people in England, and a
few days later they started. She took the children to see their father's
grave the last thing before they left Castletownrock, and stood beside
it for a long time in silence, her gloveless hand resting caressingly on
the cold tombstone, her eyes full of tears, and a pained expression in
her face. It was the real moment of separation for her. She had to tear
herself away from her beloved dead, to leave him lonely, and to go out
alone herself, unprotected, unloved, uncomforted, into the cold world
with her helpless children. Poverty was in store for her; that she knew;
and doubtless she foresaw many another trouble, and, could she have
chosen, would gladly have taken her place there beside the one who, with
all his faults, had been her best friend on earth.</p>

<p>Her cold, formal religion was no comfort to her in moments like these.
She was a pagan at heart, and where she had laid her dead, there, to her
mind, he would rest for ever, far from her. The lonely grave on the wild
west coast was the shrine towards which her poor heart would yearn
thereafter at all times, always. She had erected a handsome tombstone on
the hallowed spot, and was going away in her shabby clothes, the more at
ease for the self-denial she had had to exercise in order to beautify
it. The radical difference between herself and Beth, which was to keep
them apart for ever, was never more apparent than at this moment of
farewell. The other children cried, but Beth remained an unmoved
spectator of her mother's emotion. She hated the delay in that painful
place; and what was the use of it when her father would be with them
just the same when they got into the yellow coach which was waiting at
the gate to take them away? Beth's beloved was a spirit, near at hand
always; her mother's was a corpse in a coffin, buried in the ground.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>A little way out of Castletownrock the coach was stopped, and Honor and
Kathleen Mayne from the inn came up to the window.</p>

<p>"We walked out to be the last to say good-bye to you, Mrs. Caldwell, and
to wish you good luck," Kathleen said. "We were among the first to
welcome you when you came. And we've brought a piece of music for Miss
Mildred, if she will accept it for a keepsake."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell shook hands with them, but she could not speak; and the
coach drove on. The days when she had thought the two Miss Maynes
presumptuous for young women in their position seemed a long way off to
her as she sat there, sobbing, but grateful for this last act of kindly
feeling.</p>

<p>Beth had been eager to be off in the yellow coach, but they had not long
started before she began to suffer. The moving panorama of desolate
landscape, rocky coast, rough sea, moor and mountain, with the motion of
the coach, and the smell of stale tobacco and beer in inn-parlours where
they waited to change horses, nauseated her to faintness. Her sensitive
nervous system received too many vivid impressions at once; the intense
melancholy of the scenes they passed through, the wretched hovels, the
half-clad people, the lean cattle, and all the evidences of abject
poverty, amid dreadful bogs under a gloomy sky, got hold of her and
weighed upon her spirits, until at last she shrunk into her corner, pale
and still, and sat with her eyes closed, and great tears running slowly
down her cheeks. These were her last impressions of Ireland, and they
afterwards coloured all her recollections of the country and the people.</p>

<p>But the travellers came to a railway station at last, and left the
coach. There was a long crowded train just about to start; and Mrs.
Caldwell, dragging Beth after her by the hand, because she knew she
would stand still and stare about her the moment she let her go, hurried
from carriage to carriage, trying to find seats.</p>

<p>"I saw some," Beth said. "You've passed them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell turned, and, some distance back, found a carriage with
only two people in it, a gentleman whom Beth did not notice
particularly, and a lady, doubtless a bride, dressed in light garments,
and a white bonnet, very high in front, the space between the forehead
and the top being filled with roses. She sat upright in the middle of
the compartment, and looked superciliously at the weary, worried widow,
and her helpless children, in their shabby black, when they stopped at
the carriage door. It was her cold indifference that impressed Beth. She
could not understand why, seeing how worn they all were and the fix they
were in, she did not jump up instantly and open the door, overjoyed to
be able to help them. There were just four seats in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> carriage, but
she never moved. Beth had looked up confidently into her face, expecting
sympathy and help, but was repelled by a disdainful glance. It was
Beth's first experience of the wealthy world that does not care, and she
never forgot it.</p>

<p>"That carriage is engaged," her mother exclaimed, and dragged her
impatiently away.</p>

<p>In the hotel in Dublin where they slept a night, they had the use of a
long narrow sitting-room, with one large window at the end, hung with
handsome, heavy, dark green curtains, quite new. The valance at the top
ended in a deep fringe of thick cords, and at the end of each cord there
was a bright ornamental thing made of wood covered with silks of various
colours. Beth had never seen anything so lovely, and on the instant she
determined to have one. They were high out of her reach; but that was
nothing if only she could get a table and chair under them, and the
coast clear. Fortune favoured her during the evening, and she managed to
secure one, and carried it off in triumph; and so great was her joy in
the colour, that she took it out of her pocket whenever she had a chance
next day, and gazed at it enraptured. On their way to the boat Mildred
caught her looking at it, and asked her where she got it.</p>

<p>Beth explained exactly.</p>

<p>"But it's stealing!" Mildred exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Beth, in pleased surprise. She had never stolen anything
before, and it was a new sensation.</p>

<p>"But don't you know stealing is very wicked?" Mildred asked
impressively.</p>

<p>Beth looked disconcerted: "I never thought of that. I'll put it back."</p>

<p>"How can you? You'll never be there again," Mildred rejoined. "You've
done it now. You've committed a sin."</p>

<p>Beth slipped the bright thing into her pocket. "I'll repent," she said,
and seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day, and the passage from Kingstown to Holyhead was so
smooth that everybody lounged about the deck, and no one was ill. Beth
was very much interested, first in the receding shore, then in the
people about her. There was one group in particular, evidently of
affluent people, dressed in a way that made her feel ashamed of her own
clothes for the first time in her life. But what particularly attracted
her attention were some bunches of green and purple grapes which the
papa of the party took out of a basket and began to divide. Beth had
never seen grapes before except in pictures, and thought they looked
lovely. The old gentleman gave the grapes to his family, but in handing
them, one little bunch fell on the deck. He picked it up, looked at it,
blew some dust off it; then decided that it was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> not good enough for his
own children, and handed it to Bernadine, who was gazing greedily.</p>

<p>Beth dashed forward, snatched it out of her hand, and threw it into the
sea.</p>

<p>"We are not beggars!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Well done, little one," a gentleman who was sitting near exclaimed.
"Won't pick up the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table, eh?
That's a very proper spirit. And who may you be?"</p>

<p>"My father was a gentleman," Beth answered hotly.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Uncle James Patten</span> sent a landau to meet his sister and her family at
the station, on their arrival from Ireland. Mildred was the first to
jump in. She took the best seat, and sat up stiff and straight.</p>

<p>"I do love carriages and horses, mamma," she said, as they drove through
Rainharbour, the little north-country seaside place which was henceforth
to be their home. "I wonder which is to be our house. There are several
empty. Do you think it is that one?" She had singled out one of the
largest in the place.</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Caldwell rather bitterly, "more likely this," and she
indicated a tiny two-storied tenement, wedged in between tall houses,
and looking as if it had either got itself there by mistake, or had been
put in in a hurry, just to fill up.</p>

<p>"That <i>is</i> the one," Beth said.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Mildred snapped.</p>

<p>"Because we're going to live in Orchard Street, opposite the orchard;
and this is Orchard Street, and there's the orchard, and that's the only
house empty."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the child is right," Mrs. Caldwell said with a sigh.
"However," she added, pulling herself up, "it is exceedingly kind of
Uncle James to give us a house at all."</p>

<p>"He might have given us something nicer," Mildred remarked disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Beth exclaimed, "he's given us the best he has, I expect. And it's
a dear little place, with a little bow-window on either side of a little
front door&mdash;just like the one where Snowdrop found the empty beds when
the bears were out."</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Beth," Mildred cried crossly.</p>

<p>But Beth hardly heard. She was busy peopling the quaint little town with
the friends of her fancy, and sat smiling serenely as she looked about
her.</p>

<p>They had to drive right through Rainharbour, and about a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> mile out into
the country on the other side, to arrive at Fairholm, Uncle James
Patten's place. The sun had set, and the quaintly irregular red-brick
houses, mellowed by age, shone warm in tint against the gathering grey
of the sky, which rose like a leaden dome above them. At one part of the
road the sea came in sight. Great dark mountainous masses of cloud, with
flame-coloured fringes, hung suspended over its shining surface, in
which they were reflected with what was to Beth terrible effect. She sat
and shivered with awe so long as the lurid scene was in sight, and was
greatly relieved when the carriage turned into a country lane, and sea
and sombre sky were blotted out.</p>

<p>It was early spring. Buds were bursting in the hedgerows, birds were
building, songsters sang among the branches, and the air was sweet and
mild. Fairholm lay all among fertile fields, well wooded and watered. It
was a typical English home, with surroundings as unlike the great, bare,
bald mountains and wild Atlantic seas Beth had hitherto shuddered
amongst, as peace is unlike war. Certain natures are stimulated by the
grandeur of such scenes; but Beth was too delicate an instrument to be
played upon so roughly. Storms within reflected the storms without only
too readily. She was tempest-tossed by temperament, and, in nature, all
her yearning was for repose; so that now, as they drove up the
well-ordered avenue to the house, the tender tone of colour, green
against quiet grey, and the easy air of affluence, so soothing after the
sorrowful signs of a hard struggle for life by which her feelings had
hitherto been harrowed, drew from her a deep sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The hall-door stood open, but no one was looking out for them. They
could hear the tinkle of a piano in the distance. Then a servant
appeared, followed by a stout lady, who came forward to greet them in a
hurried, nervous way.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," she said, kissing Mrs. Caldwell. She spoke in a
breathless undertone, as if she were saying something wrong, and was
afraid of being caught and stopped before she had finished the sentence.
"I should like to have gone to meet you, but James said there were too
many for the carriage as it was. He says more than two in the carriage
makes it look like an excursion-party. But I was listening for you, only
I don't hear very well, you know. You remember me, Mildred? This is
Beth, I suppose, and this is Bernadine. You don't know who I am? I am
your Aunt Grace Mary. James begs you to excuse him for a little,
Caroline. It is his half-hour for exercises. So unfortunate. If you had
only come a little later! But, however, the sooner the better for me.
Come into the dining-room and see Aunt Victoria. We must stay there
until Uncle James has finished practising his exercises in the
drawing-room."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Great-Aunt Victoria Bench was sitting bolt upright on a high chair in
the dining-room, tatting. Family portraits, hung far too high all round
the room, seemed to have been watching her complacently until the
travellers entered, when they all turned instantly and looked hard at
Beth.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria was a tall thin old lady, with a beautiful delicate
complexion, an auburn front and white cap, and a severely simple black
dress. She rose stiffly to receive Mrs. Caldwell, and kissed her on both
cheeks with restrained emotion. Then she shook hands with each of the
children.</p>

<p>"I hope you had a pleasant journey," she was beginning formally, when
Mrs. Caldwell suddenly burst into tears. "What is the matter, Caroline?"
Aunt Victoria asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," the poor lady answered in a broken voice. "Only it does
seem a sad home-returning&mdash;alone&mdash;without <i>him</i>&mdash;you know."</p>

<p>Aunt Grace Mary furtively patted Mrs. Caldwell on the back, keeping an
eye on Aunt Victoria the while, however, as if she were afraid of being
caught.</p>

<p>All this time the tinkle-tinkle-tinkle of "Hamilton's Exercises for
Beginners" on the piano had been going on; now it stopped. Aunt Grace
Mary slipped into a chair, and sat with a smile on her face; Aunt
Victoria became a trifle more rigid over her tatting; and Mrs. Caldwell
hurriedly wiped her eyes. Then the door opened deliberately, and there
entered a great stout man, with red hair sprinkled with grey, large
prominent light-coloured eyes, a nondescript nose, a wide shapeless gash
of a mouth, and a red moustache with straight bristly hairs, like the
bristles of a broom.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Caroline?" he said, holding out his big, fat, white
hand, and kissing her coldly on the forehead. He drawled his words out
with a decided lisp, and in a very soft voice, which contrasted oddly
with his huge bulk. Having greeted his sister, he turned and looked at
the children. Mildred went up and shook hands with him.</p>

<p>"Your sisters, I perceive, have no manners," he observed.</p>

<p>Beth had been beaming round blandly on the group; but upon that last
remark of Uncle James's the pleased smile faded from her face, and she
coloured painfully, and offered him a small reluctant hand.</p>

<p>"You are Elizabeth, I suppose?" he said.</p>

<p>"I am Beth," she answered emphatically.</p>

<p>She and Uncle James looked into each other's eyes for an instant, and in
that instant she made a most disagreeable impression of fearlessness on
the big man's brain.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p><p>
"I hope, Caroline," he said precisely, "that you will not continue to
call your daughter by such an absurd abbreviation. That sort of thing
was all very well in the wilds of Ireland, but here we must have
something rational, ladylike, and recognised."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell looked distressed. "It would be so difficult to call her
Elizabeth," she pleaded. "She is not at all&mdash;Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"You may call me what you like, mamma," Beth put in with decision; "but
I shall only answer to Beth. That was the name my father gave me, and I
shall stick to it."</p>

<p>Uncle James stared at her in amazement, but Beth, unabashed, stared back
obstinately; and so they continued staring until Aunt Grace Mary made a
diversion.</p>

<p>"James," she hurriedly interposed, "wouldn't they like some
refreshment?"</p>

<p>Uncle James pulled the bell-rope. "Bring wine and cake," he lisped, when
the servant answered.</p>

<p>Then he returned to his seat, crossed one great leg over the other,
folded his fat hands on his knee, and inspected his sister.</p>

<p>"You certainly do not grow younger, Caroline," he observed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell did not look cheered by the remark; and there was a
painful pause, broken, happily, by the arrival of the cake and wine.</p>

<p>"You will not take more than half a glass, I suppose, Caroline, at
<i>this</i> time of the day," Uncle James said playfully, as he took up the
decanter; "and marsala, <i>not</i> port. I know what ladies are."</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Caldwell was exhausted, and would have been the better for a
good glass of port; but she meekly held her peace.</p>

<p>Then Uncle James cut the cake, and gave each of the children a very
small slice. Beth held hers suspended half-way to her mouth, and gazed
at her uncle.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> that child staring at?" he asked her mother at last.</p>

<p>"I think she is admiring you," was Mrs. Caldwell's happy rejoinder.</p>

<p>"No, mamma, I am not," Beth contradicted. "I was just thinking I had
never seen anything so big in my life."</p>

<p>"<i>Anything!</i>" Uncle James protested. "What does she mean, Caroline?"</p>

<p>"I don't mean this slice of cake," Beth chuckled.</p>

<p>"Come, dear&mdash;come, dear," Aunt Grace Mary hurriedly interposed. "Come
upstairs, and see&mdash;and see&mdash;the pretty room you're to have. Come and
take your things off, like a good child."</p>

<p>Beth rose obediently, but before she followed her aunt out of the room
she said: "Here, Bernadine; you'd better have my slice. You'll howl if
you don't get enough. Cakes are scarce and dear here, I suppose."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Victoria had tatted diligently during this little scene. Now she
looked up over her spectacles and inspected Uncle James.</p>

<p>"I like that child," she said decidedly.</p>

<p>"In which respect I should think you would probably find yourself in a
very small minority," Uncle James lisped, spreading his mouth into what
would have been a smile in any other countenance, but was merely an
elongation of the lips in his.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell rocked herself forlornly. Mildred nestled close to her
mother; while Baby Bernadine, with a slice of cake in each hand, took a
mouthful first from the right and then from the left, impartially.</p>

<p>Uncle James gazed at her. "I suppose that is an Irish custom," he said
at length.</p>

<p>"Bernadine! what are you doing?" Mrs. Caldwell snapped; and Bernadine,
startled, let both slices fall on the floor, and set up a howl with her
mouth full.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Uncle James murmured tenderly. "Little children are such darling
things! They make the sense of their presence felt the moment they enter
a house. It becomes visible also in the crumbs on the floor. There is
evidently nothing the matter with her lungs. But I should have thought
it would be dangerous to practise her voice like that with the mouth
full. Perhaps she would be more at her ease upstairs." Mrs. Caldwell
took the hint.</p>

<p>When the child had gone, Uncle James rang for a servant to sweep up the
cake and crumbs, and carefully stood over her, superintending.</p>

<p>"That will do," he said at length, "so far as the cake and crumbs are
concerned, but I beg you to observe that you have brushed the pile of
the carpet the wrong way."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Aunt Grace Mary had taken Beth up a polished staircase,
through a softly carpeted, airy corridor, at the end of which was a
large room with two great mahogany four-post beds, hung with brown
damask, the rest of the heavy old-fashioned furniture being to match.
All over the house there was a delicious odour of fresh air and
lavender, everything shone resplendent, and all was orderly to the point
of stiffness; nothing looked as if it had ever been used.</p>

<p>"This was your mamma's room when she was a girl," Aunt Grace Mary
confided to Beth. "She used to fill the house with her girl-friends, and
that was why she had such big beds. She used to be a very high-spirited
girl, your dear mamma was. You are all to sleep here."</p>

<p>"How good it smells," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the lavender. I often burn lavender. Would you like to see
me burn some lavender? Come to my room, then, and I'll show you. But
take your things off first."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth dragged off her hat and jacket and threw them aside. They happened
to fall on the floor.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" Aunt Grace Mary exclaimed, "look at your things!"</p>

<p>Beth looked at them, but nothing occurred to her; so she looked at her
aunt inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I always put mine away&mdash;at least I should, you know, if I hadn't a
maid," said Aunt Grace Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, let your maid put mine away too," Beth answered casually.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, you must learn," Aunt Grace Mary insisted, picking
up Beth's things and putting them in a drawer as she spoke. "Who puts
your things away at home?"</p>

<p>"Mamma," Beth answered laconically. "She says it's less trouble to do
things herself."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must save your mother the trouble, dear," said Aunt Grace
Mary in a shocked tone.</p>

<p>"Well, I will next time&mdash;if I remember," Beth rejoined. "Come and burn
lavender."</p>

<p>For the next few days, which happened to be very fine, Beth revelled out
of doors. Everything was a wonder and a joy to her in this fertile land,
the trees especially, after the bleak, wild wastes to which she had been
accustomed in the one stormy corner of Ireland she knew. Leaves and
blossoms were just bursting out, and one day, wandering alone in the
grounds, she happened unawares upon an orchard in full bloom, and fairly
gasped, utterly overcome by the first shock of its beauty. For a while
she stood and gazed in silent awe at the white froth of flowers on the
pear-trees, the tinted almond blossom, and the pink-tipped apple. She
had never dreamed of such heavenly loveliness. But enthusiasm succeeded
to awe at last, and, in a wild burst of delight, she suddenly threw her
arms around a gnarled tree-trunk and clasped it close.</p>

<p>There was a large piece of artificial water in the grounds, in which
were three green islands covered with trees and shrubs. Beth was
standing on the bank one morning in a contemplative mood, admiring the
water, and yearning for a boat to get to the islands, when round one of
them, unexpectedly, a white wonder of a swan came gliding towards her in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Mildred! Mildred! Oh, the beautiful, beautiful thing!" she
cried. Mildred came running up.</p>

<p>"Why, Beth, you idiot," she exclaimed in derision, "it's only a swan. I
really thought it <i>was</i> something."</p>

<p>"Is that a swan?" Beth said slowly; then, after a moment, she added, in
sorrowful reproach: "O Mildred! you had seen it and you never told me."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas, poor Mildred! she had not seen it, and never would see it, in
Beth's sense of the word.</p>

<p>On wet days, when they had to be indoors, Aunt Grace Mary waylaid Beth
continually, and trotted her off somewhere out of Uncle James's way. She
would take her to her own room sometimes, a large, bright apartment,
spick-and-span like the rest of the house; and show her the
pictures&mdash;pastels and water-colours chiefly&mdash;with which it was stiffly
decorated.</p>

<p>"That was your uncle when he was a little boy," she said, pointing to a
pretty pastel.</p>

<p>"Why, he was quite a nice little boy," Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, nice and plump," Aunt Grace Mary rattled off breathlessly. "And
your grandmamma did those water-colours and those screens. That lovely
printing too; can you guess how she did it? With a camel's hair brush.
She did indeed. And she used to compose music. She was a very clever
woman. You are very like her."</p>

<p>"But I am not very clever," said Beth.</p>

<p>"No, dear; no, dear," Aunt Grace Mary rejoined, pulling herself up
hurriedly from this indiscretion. "But in the face. You are very like
her in appearance. And you must try. You must try to improve yourself.
Your uncle is always trying to improve himself. He reads 'Doctor Syntax'
aloud to us. In the evening it is our custom to read aloud and
converse."</p>

<p>An occasional phrase of Uncle James's would flow from Aunt Grace Mary in
this way, with incongruous effect.</p>

<p>"Do you try to improve yourself?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;that reminds me. I must write a letter. You shall stay and
see me if you like. But you mustn't move or speak."</p>

<p>Beth, deeply interested, watched her aunt, who began by locking the
door. Then she slipped a pair of spectacles out of her pocket, and put
them on, after glancing round apprehensively as if she were going to do
something wrong. Then she sat down at a small bureau, unlocked a drawer,
and took out a little dictionary, unlocked another drawer and took out a
sheet of notepaper, in which she inserted a page of black lines. Then
she proceeded to write a letter in lead-pencil, stopping often to
consult the dictionary. When she had done, she took out another sheet of
a better quality, put the lines in it, and proceeded to copy the letter
in ink. She blotted the first attempt, but the next she finished. She
destroyed several envelopes also before she was satisfied. But at last
the letter was folded and sealed, and then she carefully burnt every
scrap of paper she had spoiled.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was educated in a convent in France," she said to Beth. "If you were
older you would know that by my handwriting. It is called an Italian
hand, but I learnt it in France. I was there five years."</p>

<p>"What else did you learn?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;reading. No&mdash;I could read before I went. But music, you know, and
French."</p>

<p>"Say some French," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't," Aunt Grace Mary answered. "But I can read it a little,
you know."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear you play," said Beth.</p>

<p>"But I don't play," Aunt Grace Mary rejoined.</p>

<p>"I thought you said you learnt music."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. I had to learn music; and I practised for hours every day; but
I never played."</p>

<p>Aunt Grace Mary smiled complacently as she spoke, took off her
spectacles, and locked up her writing materials&mdash;Beth, the while,
thoughtfully observing her. Aunt Grace Mary's hair was a wonderful
colour, neither red, yellow, brown, nor white, but a mixture of all
four. It was parted straight in the middle, where it was thin, and
brought down in two large rolls over her ears. She wore a black velvet
band across her head like a coronet, which ended in a large black velvet
bow at the back. Long heavy gold ear-rings pulled down the lobes of her
ears. All her dresses were of rustling silk, and she had a variety of
deep lace-collars, each one of which she fastened with a different
brooch at the throat. She also wore a heavy gold watch-chain round her
neck, the watch being concealed in her bosom; and jet bracelets by day,
but gold ones in the evening.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Beth was deeply interested in her own family history, and intelligently
pieced together such fragments of it as she could collect from the
conversations of the people about her. She was sitting in one of the
deep window-seats in the drawing-room looking out one day, concealed by
a curtain, when her mother and Great-Aunt Victoria Bench came into the
room, and settled themselves to chat and sew without observing her.</p>

<p>"Where is Grace Mary?" Aunt Victoria asked.</p>

<p>"Locked up in her own room writing a letter, I believe," Mrs. Caldwell
replied, "a long and mysterious proceeding. We shall not see her again
this morning, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said Aunt Victoria considerately, "she writes a very
beautiful hand."</p>

<p>"James thought he was doing so well for himself, too!" Mrs. Caldwell
interjected. "He'd better have married the mother."</p>

<p>"There was the making of a fine woman in Grace Mary if

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> she had had a
chance," Aunt Victoria answered, pursing up her mouth judicially. "It
was the mother made the match. When he came across them in Switzerland,
Lady Benyon got hold of him, and flattered him, made him believe Grace
Mary was only thirty-eight, not too old for a son-and-heir, but much too
old for a large family. She was really about fifty; but he never thought
of looking up her age until after they were married. However, James got
one thing he likes, and more than he deserved; for Grace Mary is amiable
if she's ignorant; and I should say had tact, though some people might
call it cunning. But, at any rate, she's the daughter of one baronet and
the sister of another."</p>

<p>"What's a baronet?" Beth demanded, tumbling off the window-seat on to
the floor with a crash as she spoke, having lost her balance in peering
round the curtain.</p>

<p>Both ladies jumped, quite contrary to their principles.</p>

<p>"You naughty child, how dare you?" Mrs. Caldwell began.</p>

<p>Beth picked herself up. "I want to know," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"You've been listening."</p>

<p>"No, I've not. I was here first, and you came and talked. But that
doesn't matter. I shan't tell. What's a baronet?"</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria explained, and then turned her out of the room. Uncle
James was crossing the hall at the moment; he had a large bunch of keys
in his hand, and went through the double-doors which led to the kitchen
and offices. Beth followed him into the kitchen. The cook, an old
servant, came forward curtseying. The remains of yesterday's dinner,
cold roast beef, tongue, chicken, and plum-pudding, were spread out on
the table. Uncle James inspected everything.</p>

<p>"For luncheon," he said, "the beef can remain cold on the sideboard,
also the tongue. The chicken you will grill for one hot dish, and do not
forget to garnish with rolls of bacon. The pudding you can cut into
slices, fry, and sprinkle with a little sifted sugar. Mind, I say a
little; for, as the pudding is sweet enough already, the sugar is merely
an ornament to make it agreeable to the eye. For the rest, as usual."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And dinner, sir?"</p>

<p>"Here is the <i>menu</i>." He handed her a paper. "I will give you out what
is necessary."</p>

<p>He led the way down a stone passage to the store-room door, which he
unlocked.</p>

<p>"I am out of sifted sugar, sir," the cook said nervously.</p>

<p>"What, again?" Uncle James sternly demanded. "This is only Thursday, and
I gave you some out on Saturday."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but only a quarter of a pound, sir, and I had to use it for
the top of the rice-pudding, and the pancakes, and the Charlotte Russe,
and the plum-pudding&mdash;&mdash;"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"How?" said Uncle James&mdash;"the plum-pudding, which is not yet fried?"</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir. I'm all confused. But, however," she added
desperately, "the sugar is done."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must give you some more this time. But do not let it
occur again. You may weigh out a quarter of a pound."</p>

<p>When that was done, Uncle James consulted a huge cookery-book which lay
on a shelf in the window. "We shall require another cake for tea," he
said, and then proceeded to read the recipe aloud, keeping an observant
eye upon the cook as she weighed out the various ingredients.</p>

<p>"And the kitchen meals, sir?" she asked, as he locked up the store-room.</p>

<p>"Make what you have do," he said, "make what you have do."</p>

<p>"But there is hardly meat enough to go round once, sir."</p>

<p>"You must make it do. People are much healthier and happier when they do
not eat too much."</p>

<p>This ceremony over, he went to the poultry-yard, followed by Beth (who
carefully kept in the background), the yard-boy, and the poultry-maid
who carried some corn in a sieve, which she handed to her master when he
stopped. Uncle James scattered a little corn on the ground, calling
"chuck! chuck! chuck!" at the same time, in a dignified manner.
Chickens, ducks, turkeys and guinea-fowl collected about him, and he
stood gazing at them with large light prominent eyes, blandly, as if he
loved them&mdash;as indeed he did when they appeared like ladies at table,
dressed to perfection.</p>

<p>"That guinea-fowl!" he decided, after due consideration.</p>

<p>The yard-boy caught it and gave it to the poultry-maid, who held it
while Uncle James carefully felt its breast.</p>

<p>"That will do," he said. "Quite a beauty."</p>

<p>The yard-boy took it from the poultry-maid, tied its legs together, cut
its throat, and hung it on a nail.</p>

<p>"That drake!" Uncle James proceeded. The same ceremony followed, Uncle
James bearing his part in it without any relaxation of his grand manner.</p>

<p>When a turkey-poult had also been executed, he requested the yard-boy to
fetch him his gun from the harness-room.</p>

<p>"We must have a pigeon-pie," he observed as he took it.</p>

<p>Beth, in great excitement, stalked him to the orchard, where there was a
big pigeon-house covered with ivy. In front of it the pigeons had a good
run, enclosed with wire netting when they were shut in; but they were
often let out to feed in the fields. The yard-boy now reached up and
opened a little door in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
 side of the house. As he did so he glanced
at Uncle James somewhat apprehensively. Uncle James, with a benign
countenance, suddenly lifted his gun and fired. The yard-boy dropped.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said Uncle James.</p>

<p>The yard-boy gathered himself up with a very red face. "I thought you
meant to shoot me, sir."</p>

<p>Uncle James smiled gently. "May I ask when it became customary for
gentlemen to shoot yard-boys?" he said.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," the boy rejoined sheepishly. "There's accidents
sometimes."</p>

<p>The pigeons were wary after the shot, and would not come out, so the
yard-boy had to go into the house and drive them. There was a shelf in
front of the little door, on which they generally rested a moment,
bewildered, before they flew. Uncle James knew them all by sight, and
let several go, as being too old for his purpose. Then, standing pretty
close, he shot two, one after the other, as they stood hesitating to
take flight. While loading again, he discovered Beth; but as he liked an
audience when he was performing an exploit, he was quite gracious.</p>

<p>"Nothing distinguishes a gentleman more certainly than a love of sport,"
he observed blandly, as he shot another pigeon sitting.</p>

<p>This entertainment over, he looked at his watch. He had the whole day
divided into hours and half-hours, each with its separate occupation or
recreation; and nothing short of a visit from some personage of
importance was ever allowed to interrupt him in any of his pursuits. For
recreation he sometimes did a little knitting or a piece of Berlin
woolwork, because, he said, a gentleman should learn to do everything,
so as not to be at a loss if he were ever wrecked on a desert island.
For the same reason, he had also trained himself to sleep at odd times,
and in all sorts of odd places, choosing by preference some corner where
Aunt Grace Mary and the maids would least expect to find him, the
consequence being wild shrieks and shocks to their nerves, such as, to
use his own bland explanation, might be expected from undisciplined
females. Beth found him one day spread out on a large oak chest in the
main corridor upstairs, with two great china vases, one at his head and
one at his feet, filled with reeds and bulrushes, which appeared to be
waving over him, and looking in his sleep, with his cadaverous
countenance, like a self-satisfied corpse. She had been on her way
downstairs to dispose of the core of an apple she had eaten; but, as
Uncle James's mouth was open, she left it there.</p>

<p>Uncle James was wont to deliver little lectures to the children, for the
improvement of their minds, during luncheon, which was their
dinner-hour.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"With regularity and practice you may accomplish great things," he said
on one occasion. "I myself always practise 'Hamilton's Exercises' on the
pianoforte for one hour every day, from half-past ten till eleven, and
from half-past three till four. I have done so now for many years."</p>

<p>Beth sat with her spoon suspended half-way up to her mouth, drinking in
these words of wisdom. "And when will you be able to play?" she asked.</p>

<p>Uncle James fixed his large, light, ineffectual eyes upon her; but, as
usual, this gaze direct only excited Beth's interest, and she returned
it unabashed in simple expectation of what was to follow. So Uncle James
gave in, and to cover his retreat he said: "Culture. Cultivate the mind.
There is nothing that elevates the mind like general cultivation. It is
cultivation that makes us great, good, and generous."</p>

<p>"Then, I suppose, when your mind is cultivated, Uncle James, you will
give mamma more money," Beth burst out hopefully.</p>

<p>Uncle James blinked his eyes several times running, rapidly, as if
something had gone wrong with them.</p>

<p>"Beth, you are talking too much; go to your room <i>at once</i>, and stay
there for a punishment," her mother exclaimed nervously.</p>

<p>Beth, innocent of any intent to offend, looked surprised, put down her
spoon deliberately, got off her chair, took up her plate of pudding, and
was making off with it. As she was passing Uncle James, however, he
stretched out his big hand suddenly, and snatched the plate from her;
but Beth in an instant doubled her little fist, and struck the plate
from underneath, the concussion scattering the pudding all over the
front of Uncle James.</p>

<p>In the confusion which followed, Beth made her escape to the kitchen,
where she was already popular.</p>

<p>"I say, cook," she coaxed, "give me something good to eat. My pudding's
got upset all over Uncle James."</p>

<p>The cook sat down suddenly, and twinkled a glance of intelligence at
Horner, the old coachman, who happened to be in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Give me a cheesecake&mdash;I won't tell," Beth pleaded.</p>

<p>"That's doubtful, I should think," Horner said aside to the cook.</p>

<p>"Oh, bless you, she never do, not she!" cook answered, and then she
fetched Beth a big cheesecake from a secret store. Beth took it smiling,
and retired to the brown bedroom, where she was left in solitary
confinement until Uncle James drove out with mamma in Aunt Grace Mary's
pony-carriage to pay a call in the afternoon. When they had gone, Aunt
Grace Mary peeped in at Beth, and said, with an unconvincing affectation
of anger: "Beth, you are a naughty little girl, and deserve to be
punished.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
 Say you're sorry. Then you shall come to my room, and see me
write a letter."</p>

<p>"All right," Beth answered, and Aunt Grace Mary took her off without
more ado.</p>

<p>It was a great encouragement to Beth to find that Aunt Grace Mary was
obliged to take pains with her writing. All the other grown-up people
Beth knew, seemed to do everything with such ease, it was quite
disheartening. Beth was allowed a pencil, a sheet of paper, and some
lines herself now, and Aunt Grace Mary was taking great pains to teach
her to write an Italian hand. Beth was also trying to learn: "because
there are such lots of things I want to write down," she explained; "and
I want to do it small like you, because it won't take so much paper, you
know."</p>

<p>"What kind of things do you want to write down, Beth?" Aunt Grace Mary
asked. Beth treated her quite as an equal, so they chatted the whole
time they were together, unconstrainedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know&mdash;things like&mdash;well, the day we came here there were great
grey clouds with crimson caps hanging over the sea, and you could see
them in the water."</p>

<p>"See their reflection, you mean, I suppose."</p>

<p>Beth looked puzzled. "When you think of things, isn't that reflection?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; and when you see yourself in the looking-glass, that's your
reflection too," Aunt Grace Mary answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, then I suppose it was the sea's thought of the sky I saw in the
water&mdash;that makes it nicer than I had it before," Beth said, trying to
turn the phrase as a young bird practises to round its notes in the
spring. "The sea shows its thoughts, the thought of the sea is the
sky&mdash;no, that isn't right. It never does come right all at once, you
know. But that's the kind of thing."</p>

<p>"What kind of thing?" Aunt Grace Mary asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"The kind of thing I am always wanting to write down. You generally
forget what we're talking about, don't you?&mdash;I say, don't you want to
drive your own ponies yourself sometimes?"</p>

<p>"No, not when your dear uncle wants them."</p>

<p>"Dear uncle wants them almost always, doesn't he? Horner ses as 'ow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beth, don't speak like that!"</p>

<p>"That's Horner, not me," Beth snapped, impatient of the interruption.
"How am I to tell you what he said if I don't say what he said? Horner
ses as 'ow, when Lady Benyon gev them there white ponies to 'er darter
fur 'er own use, squire 'e sells two on 'is 'orses, an' 'as used them
ponies ever since. Squire's a near un, my word!" Beth perceived that
Aunt Grace Mary looked very funny in the face. "You're frightened to
death of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
 Uncle James, arn't you?" she asked, after sucking her pencil
meditatively for a little.</p>

<p>"No, dear, of course not. I am not afraid of any one but the dear Lord."</p>

<p>"But Uncle James <i>is</i> the lord."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, child."</p>

<p>"Mildred says so. She says he's lord of the manor. Mildred says it's
fine to be lord of the manor. But it doesn't make me care a button about
Uncle James."</p>

<p>"Don't speak like that, Beth. It's disrespectful. It was the Lord in
heaven I alluded to," said Aunt Grace Mary in her breathless way.</p>

<p>"Ah, that <i>is</i> different," Beth allowed. "But I'm not afraid of Him
either. I don't think I'm afraid of any one really, not even of mamma,
though she does beat me. I'd rather she didn't, you know. But one gets
used to it. The worst of it is," Beth added, after sucking the point of
her pencil a little&mdash;"The worst of it is, you never know what will make
her waxy. To-day, at luncheon, you know&mdash;now, what did I say?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Aunt Grace Mary vaguely; "you oughtn't to have said it, you
know."</p>

<p>"Now, that's just like mamma! She says 'Don't!' and 'How dare you!' and
'Naughty girl!' at the top of her voice, and half the time I don't know
what she's talking about. When I grow up, I shall explain to children.
Do you know, sometimes I quite want to be good"&mdash;this with a sigh. "But
when I'm bad without having a notion what I've done, why, it's
difficult. Aunt Grace Mary, do you know what Neptune would say if the
sea dried up?" Aunt Grace Mary smiled and shook her head. "I haven't an
ocean," Beth proceeded. "You don't see it? Well, I didn't at first. You
see <i>an ocean</i> and <i>a notion</i> sound the same if you say them sharp. Now,
do you see? They call that a pun."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman in the train."</p>

<p>Beth put her pencil in her mouth, and gazed up at the sky. "I don't
suppose he'd be such a black-hearted villain as to break his word," she
said at last.</p>

<p>"Who?" Aunt Grace Mary asked, in a startled tone.</p>

<p>"Uncle James&mdash;about leaving Jim the place, you know. Why, don't you
know? Mamma is the eldest, and ought to have had Fairholm, but she was
away in Ireland, busy having me, when grandpapa died, and couldn't come;
so Uncle James frightened the old man into leaving the place to him, and
mamma only got fifty pounds a year, which wasn't fair."</p>

<p>"Who told you this, Beth?"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mildred. Mamma told her. And Horner said the other day to cook&mdash;I'll
have to say it the way Horner says it. If I said it my way, you know,
then it wouldn't be Horner&mdash;Horner said to cook as 'ow Captain Caldwell
'ud 'a' gone to law about it, but squire 'e swore if 'e'd let the matter
drop, 'e'd make 'is nevee, Master Jim, as is also 'is godson, 'is heir,
an' so square it; and Captain Caldwell, as was a real gen'lmon, an' fond
of the ladies, tuk 'im at 'is word, an' furgiv' 'im. But, lardie! don't
us know the worth o' Mr. James Patten's word!"</p>

<p>Aunt Grace Mary had turned very pale.</p>

<p>"Beth," she gasped, "promise me you will never, never, <i>never</i> say a
word about this to your uncle."</p>

<p>"Not likely," said Beth.</p>

<p>"How do you remember these things you hear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just think them over again when I go to bed, and then they stay,"
Beth answered. "I wouldn't tell you half I hear, though&mdash;only things
everybody knows. If you tell secrets, you know, you're a tell-pie. And
I'm not a tell-pie. Now, Bernadine is. She's a regular tell-pie. It
seems as if she couldn't help it; but then she's young," Beth added
tolerantly.</p>

<p>"Were you ever young, I wonder?" Aunt Grace Mary muttered to herself.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the English spring advanced in the beautiful gardens of
Fairholm, and was a joy to Beth. Blossoms showered from the fruit-trees,
green leaves unfurled, the birds were in full song, and the swans curved
their long necks in the sunshine, and breasted the waters of the lake,
as if their own grace were a pleasure to them. Beth was enchanted. Every
day she discovered some new wonder&mdash;nests in the hedgerows, lambs in the
fields, a foal and its mother in the paddock, a calf in the byre&mdash;more
living interests in one week than she had dreamt of in the whole of her
little life. For a happy interval the scenes which had oppressed
her&mdash;the desolation, the sombre colours of the great melancholy
mountains, the incessant sound of the turbulent sea, the shock and roar
of angry breakers warring with the rocks, which had kept her little
being all a-throb, braced to the expectation of calamity&mdash;lapsed now
into the background of her recollection, and under the benign influence
of these lovelier surroundings her mind began to expand in the most
extraordinary way, while her further faculty awoke, and gave her
glimpses of more delights than mortal mind could have shown her. "Such
nice things," as she expressed it, "keep coming into my head, and I want
to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
 write them down." Books she flung away impatiently; but the woods
and streams, and the wild flowers, the rooks returning to roost in the
trees at sunset, the horses playing in the paddocks, the cows dawdling
back from their pastures, all sweet country scents and cheerful country
sounds she became alive to and began to love. There would be trouble
enough in Beth herself at times, wherever she was; it was hard that she
could not have been kept in some such paradise always, to ease the
burden of her being.</p>

<p>One morning her mother told her that Uncle James was extremely
displeased with her because he had seen her pelting the swans.</p>

<p>"He didn't see me pelting the swans," Beth asseverated. "I was feeding
them with crusts. And how did he see me, any way? He wasn't there."</p>

<p>"He sees everything that's going on," Mrs. Caldwell assured her.</p>

<p>"He's only pretending," Beth argued, "or else he must be God."</p>

<p>But she kept her eyes about her the next time she was in the grounds,
and at last she discovered him, sitting in the little window of his
dressing-room with a book before him, and completely blocking the
aperture. She had never noticed him there before, because the panes were
small and bright, and the shine on them made it difficult to see through
them from below. After this discovery she always felt that his eyes were
upon her wherever she went within range of that window. Not that that
would have deterred her had she wanted to do anything particularly; but
even a child feels it intolerable to be spied upon; and as for a spy!
Beth scorned the creature.</p>

<p>That day at luncheon Uncle James made an announcement.</p>

<p>"Lady Benyon is going to honour us with a visit," he began in his most
impressive manner. There is no snob so inveterate as your snob of good
birth; and Uncle James said "Lady" as if it were a privilege just to
pronounce the word. "She will arrive this afternoon at a quarter to
four."</p>

<p>"But you will be practising," Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"The rites of hospitality must be observed," he condescended to inform
her.</p>

<p>"Lady Benyon is my mother, Beth," Aunt Grace Mary put in irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"I know," Beth answered. "Your papa was a baronet; Uncle James loves
baronets; that was why he married you." Having thus disposed of Aunt
Grace Mary, Beth turned to the other end of the table, and resumed: "But
you went on practising when <i>we</i> arrived, Uncle James."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle James gazed at her blandly, then looked at his sister with an
agreeable smile. "Lady Benyon will probably like to see the children.
You do not dress them in the latest fashion, I observe."</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> shabby," Mrs. Caldwell acknowledged with a sigh,
apologetically.</p>

<p>Beth shovelled some spoonfuls of pudding into her mouth very quickly.
"That's the money bother again," she said, and then she sang out at the
top of her voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bryan O'Lynn had no breeches to wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He bought a sheepskin for to make him a pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the skinny side out, and the woolly side in,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'They're warm in the winter,' said Bryan O'Lynn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I suppose it would be quite impossible to suppress this child?" Uncle
James lisped with deceptive mildness. "I observe that she joins in the
conversation always, with great intelligence and her mouth full. It
might be better, perhaps, if she emptied her mouth. However, I suppose
it would be impossible to teach her."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Beth answered for herself, cheerfully. "I'm not too stupid
to empty my mouth! Only just you tell me what it is you want. Don't
bottle things up. I expect I've been speaking with my mouth full ever
since I came, and you've been hating me for it; but you never told me."</p>

<p>"May I ask," said Uncle James politely, "by whom you were informed that
I 'bottled things up'?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that would be telling," said Beth, and recommenced gobbling her
pudding, to the intense relief of some of the party.</p>

<p>Great-Aunt Victoria Bench, sitting upright opposite, looked across the
table at the child, and a faint smile flickered over her wrinkled
rose-leaf cheek.</p>

<p>Beth finished her pudding, dropped her spoon on her plate with a
clatter, leant back in her chair, and sighed with satisfaction. She
possessed a horrid fascination for Uncle James. Almost everything she
did was an offence to him, yet he could not keep his eyes off her or let
her alone.</p>

<p>"Pudding seems to be a weakness of hers," he now observed. "I hope her
voracity is satisfied. I should say that it resembles the voracity of
the caterpillar."</p>

<p>"What's voracity, Aunt Victoria?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Greediness," Aunt Victoria rejoined sententiously.</p>

<p>"He means I'm greedy for pudding? I just <i>am</i>! I'd like to be a
caterpillar for pudding. Caterpillars eat all day. But then God's good
to them. He puts them on a tree with lots of leaves. I wish He'd put me
in a pantry with lots of puddings!

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
 My vorass&mdash;vor&mdash;what is it? Any way,
it's satisfied now, Uncle James, and if you'll let me go, I'll wash
myself, and get ready for Lady Benyon."</p>

<p>Rather than let her go when she wanted to, however, Uncle James sat some
time longer at table than he had intended. It was he who always gave the
signal to rise; before he did so on this occasion, he formally requested
his sister to request Beth to be silent during Lady Benyon's visit.</p>

<p>Lady Benyon was a shrewd, active little old woman, with four dark curls
laid horizontally on either side of her forehead. She had bright black
sparkling eyes that glanced about quickly and seemed to see everything.
Before she arrived, Uncle James assembled his family in the
drawing-room, and set the scene, as it were, for her reception.</p>

<p>"Sit here, facing the window, Caroline," he said. "It will interest Lady
Benyon to see how you have aged. And, Aunt Victoria, this Chippendale
chair, so stiff and straight, is just like you, I think; so oblige me by
sitting on it. Grace Mary, take this easy lounge; it suits your yielding
nature. Elizabeth"&mdash;Beth, who was perched on the piano-stool, looked up
calmly at the clouds through the window opposite. "Elizabeth," he
repeated sharply. Beth made no sign.</p>

<p>"Beth, answer your uncle directly," Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He has not yet addressed me," Beth rejoined, in the manner of Uncle
James.</p>

<p>"Don't call your uncle 'he,' you naughty girl. You know your name is
Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I know I said I wouldn't answer to it, and I'm not going to
break me oath."</p>

<p>"Me oath!" Uncle James ejaculated.</p>

<p>Beth looked disconcerted. It irked her horribly to be jeered at for
making a mistake in speaking, and Uncle James, seeing she was hurt,
rested satisfied for the moment, and arranged Mildred and Bernadine
together in a group, leaving Beth huddled up on the piano-stool,
frowning.</p>

<p>When Lady Benyon's carriage stopped at the door, Uncle James stood
bareheaded on the steps, ready to receive her.</p>

<p>"So glad to see you, mamma," he lisped, as he handed her out. "<i>Do</i> take
my arm."</p>

<p>But the little old lady waved him aside unceremoniously, and hobbled in
with the brisk stiffness of age.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" she exclaimed when she saw the party arranged in the
drawing-room. "You all look as if you were having your likeness
taken&mdash;all except Puck there, on the piano-stool."</p>

<p>When Uncle James had man&oelig;uvred Lady Benyon into the seat of honour he
intended her to take in order to complete the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> picture, she frankly
inspected each member of the group, ending with Beth.</p>

<p>"And who may you be?" she asked.</p>

<p>Beth smiled and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>Beth made another gesture.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" Lady Benyon cried; "is the child an idiot?"</p>

<p>"Beth, answer Lady Benyon directly," Mrs. Caldwell angrily commanded.</p>

<p>"Uncle James requested mamma to request me not to speak when you were
present," Beth explained suavely.</p>

<p>The old lady burst out laughing. "Well, that's droll," she
said&mdash;"requested mamma to request me&mdash;why, it's James Patten all over.
And who may you be, you monkey?"</p>

<p>"I am Elizabeth Caldwell, but I only answer to Beth. Papa called me
Beth."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the little old lady. "And what's Ireland like?"</p>

<p>"Great dark mountains," Beth rattled off, with big eyes dilated and
fixed on space, as if she saw what she described. "Long, long, long,
black bogs; all the poor people starving; and the sea rough&mdash;just like
hell, you know, but without the fire."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, this <i>is</i> delightful!" the old lady chuckled. "I'm to enjoy
myself to-day, it seems. You didn't prepare me for this treat, James
Patten!"</p>

<p>Uncle James simpered, as though taking to himself the credit of the
whole entertainment.</p>

<p>"So you hate Ireland?" said Lady Benyon.</p>

<p>"No, I love it," said Beth. "It's me native country; and they don't give
you little bits of cake there the size of sixpence. What they have
you're welcome to. Long live Ireland!"</p>

<p>"Good!" Lady Benyon ejaculated; then turned to Mildred. "And are you
another naughty little patriot?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, <i>I'm</i> not naughty," Mildred answered piously.</p>

<p>"Beth's naughty," said Bernadine.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know <i>what</i> Beth is not," the old lady declared,
turning to Beth again.</p>

<p>"Riley said I was one of the little girls the devil put out when he gave
up housekeeping," Beth remarked casually.</p>

<p>"Beth!" Mrs. Caldwell remonstrated.</p>

<p>"He did, mamma. He said it the day that perjured villain Pat Murphy
killed my magpie. And Riley's a good man. You said so yourself."</p>

<p>"You can hear that the young lady has been in Ireland, I suppose,
mamma," Uncle James observed.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hear she can imitate the Irish," Lady Benyon rejoined bluntly; "and
not the Irish only," she added with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Beth was still sitting on the music-stool opposite the window, and
presently she saw some one cross the lawn. "Oh, do look at the lovely
lady," she cried enthusiastically. "She's just like the Princess
Blue-eyes-and-golden-hair."</p>

<p>Lady Benyon glanced over her shoulder. "Why, it's my maid," she said.</p>

<p>Beth's countenance dropped, then cleared again. Even a maid might be a
princess in disguise.</p>

<p>Lady Benyon was going to stay all night, and at her special request
Mildred and Beth were allowed to sit up to late dinner and prayers. She
expected Beth to amuse her, but Beth was busy the whole time weaving a
romance about the lovely lady's-maid, and scarcely spoke a word. When
the servants came in to prayers, she sat and gazed at her heroine, and
forgot to stand or kneel. She noticed, however, that Uncle James read
the evening prayers with peculiar fervour.</p>

<p>When Beth went to bed, she found Bernadine, who slept with her, fast
asleep. Beth was not at all sleepy. Her intellect had been on the alert
all day, and would not let her rest now; she must do something to keep
up the excitement. She pulled the blind aside, and, looking out of the
window, discovered an enchanted land, all soft shadow and silver sheen,
and above it an exquisite moon, in an empty sky, floated serenely. "Oh,
to be out in the moonlight!" she sighed to herself. "The fairy-folk&mdash;the
fairy-folk." For a little her mind was a blank as she gazed; then words
came tripping a measure&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fairy-folk are calling me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are calling me, are calling me;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They come across the stormy sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To play with me, to play with me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beth's vague longing crisped itself into a resolution. She looked at the
big four-post bed. The curtains were drawn on one side of it. Should she
draw them on the other, on the chance of her mother not looking in? No,
she must wait, because of Mildred. Mildred was undressing, and would say
her prayers presently. Beth waited until she knelt down, then slipped
her night-dress on over her clothes, and got into bed, without
disturbing Bernadine. Now she must wait for her mother; but Mrs.
Caldwell came up very soon, Uncle James having hurried every one off to
bed unusually early that evening. Mrs. Caldwell was a long time
undressing, as it seemed to Beth; but in the meantime Mildred had fallen
asleep, and very soon after her mother got into bed she too began to
breathe with reassuring regularity.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Beth got up, opened the door very gently, and slipped out into the
dark passage.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fairy-folk are calling me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are calling me, are calling me;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They come across the stormy sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To play with me, to play with me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words set themselves to a merry tune, and carried Beth on with them.</p>

<p>All was dark in the hall. The front door was locked and bolted, and the
shutters were up in all the rooms; how was she to get out? She felt for
the green baize double-door which shut off the kitchen from the other
parts of the house, opened it, and groped her way down the passage. As
she did so, she saw a faint glimmer of light at the far end&mdash;not
candlelight, moonlight&mdash;and at the same moment she became aware of some
one else moving. At the end of the passage she was in, there was a
little door leading out into a garden. If that were open all would be
easy. She had stopped to listen. Certainly some one else was moving
quite close to her. What was she near? Oh, the store-room. Something
grated like a key in a lock&mdash;a door was opened, a match struck, a candle
lighted; and there was Mrs. Cook in the store-room itself, hurriedly
filling paper-bags with tea, sugar, raisins, currants, and other
groceries from Uncle James's carefully guarded treasure, and packing
them into a small hamper with a lid. When the hamper was full she blew
out the candle, came out of the store-room, locked the door after her,
and went into the kitchen, without discovering Beth. She left the
kitchen door open; the blind was up; and Beth could see a man, whom she
recognised as the cook's son, standing in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Is there much this time, mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A goodish bit," cook replied, handing him the hamper.</p>

<p>"'E 'asn't 'ad 'is eyes about 'im much o' late, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, 'e allus 'as 'is eyes about 'im, but 'e doan't see much. You'll get
me what ye can?"</p>

<p>"I will so," her son replied, and kissed cook as she let him out of the
back-door, which she fastened after him. Then she went off herself up
the back-stairs to bed.</p>

<p>When all was quiet again, Beth thought of the garden-door at the end of
the passage. To her relief she found it ajar; the gleam of light she had
seen in that direction was the moonlight streaming through the crevice.
She slipped out cautiously; but the moment she found herself in the
garden she became a wild creature, revelling in her freedom. She ran,
jumped, waved her arms about, threw herself down on the ground, and
rolled over and over for yards, walked on all fours, turned head over
heels, embraced

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the trunks of trees, and hailed them with the Eastern
invocation, "O tree, give me of thy strength!"</p>

<p>For a good hour she rioted about the place in this way, working off her
superfluous energy. By that time she had come to the stackyard. There,
among the great stacks, she played hide-and-seek with the fairy-folk for
a little. Very cautiously she would steal round in the black shadows,
stalking her imaginary play-fellows, and then would go flying out into
the moonlight, pursued by them in turn; and looking herself, with her
white night-dress over her clothes, and her tousled hair, the weirdest
little elfin figure in the world. Finally, to escape capture, she ran up
a ladder that had been left against a haystack. Blocks of hay had been
cut out, leaving a square shelf half way down the stack, on to which
Beth scrambled from the ladder. There was room enough for her to lie at
her ease up there and recover her breath. The hay and the night-air
smelt deliciously sweet. The stack she was on was one of the outer row.
Beneath was the road along which the waggons brought their loads in
harvest time; and this was flanked by a low wall, on the other side of
which was a meadow, bordered with elms. Beth pulled up the hay about
her, covered herself with it, and nestled amongst it luxuriously. The
moon shone full upon her, but she had quite concealed herself, and would
probably have fallen asleep after her exertions had it not been that
just when drowsiness was coming upon her she was startled by the sound
of a hurried footstep, and a girl in a light dress, with a shawl about
her shoulders, came round the stack, and stood still, looking about her,
as if she expected some one. Beth recognised her as Harriet Elvidge, the
kitchen-maid; and presently Russell, one of the grooms, came hurrying to
meet her from the other direction. They rushed into each other's arms.</p>

<p>"Thou'st la&auml;te," the girl grumbled.</p>

<p>"Ah bin waatin' ower yon'er this good bit," he answered, putting his arm
round her, and drawing her to the wall, on which they sat, leaning
against each other, and whispering happily. The moon was low, and her
great golden disk illumined the sky, against which the two dark figures
stood out, silhouetted distinctly. The effect gave Beth a sensation of
pleasure, and she racked her brains for words in which to express it.
Presently the lovers rose and strolled away together. Then for a little
it was lonely, and Beth thought of getting down; but before she had made
up her mind, two other people appeared, strolling in the moonlight, whom
Beth instantly recognised as Uncle James and the beautiful princess
Blue-eyes-and-golden-hair. The princess had both her hands clasped round
Uncle James's arm, and every now and then she nestled her face against
his shoulder lovingly.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"What will Jimmie-wimmie give his Jenny-penny?" she was saying as they
approached.</p>

<p>"First what will Jenny-penny give her Jimmie-wimmie?" Uncle James cooed.</p>

<p>"First, a nice&mdash;sweet&mdash;kiss!"</p>

<p>"Duckie-dearie!" Jimmie-wimmie gurgled ecstatically, taking the kiss
with the playful grace of an elephant gambolling.</p>

<p>Beth on the haystack writhed with suppressed merriment until her sides
ached.</p>

<p>But Jimmie-wimmie and Jenny-penny passed out of sight like Harriet and
Russell before them. The moon was sinking rapidly. A sudden gust of air
blew chill upon Beth. She was extremely sensitive to sudden changes of
temperature, and as the night grew dull and heavy, so did her mood, and
she began to be as anxious to be indoors again as she had been to come
out. The fairy-folk had all vanished now, and ghosts and goblins would
come in their stead, and pounce upon her as she passed, if she were not
quick. Beth scrambled down from the haystack, and made for the side-door
in hot haste, and was half-way upstairs, when it suddenly occurred to
her that if she locked the door, Jimmie-wimmie and Jenny-penny would not
be able to get in. So she retraced her steps, accomplished her purpose,
slipped back to bed, and slept until she was roused in the morning by a
shrill cry from Bernadine&mdash;"See, mummy! see, mummy! lazy Beth is in bed
with all her clothes on!"</p>

<p>Beth sat up, and slapped Bernadine promptly; whereupon Mrs. Caldwell
slapped Beth.</p>

<p>"Such is life," said Beth, in imitation of Aunt Grace Mary; and Mrs.
Caldwell smiled in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Later in the day Beth complained to Mildred of a bad cold in her head.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" Mildred exclaimed, "I expect Uncle James will talk at that
cold as long as it lasts."</p>

<p>"I know," Beth said. "Grace Mary, dear&mdash;or Aunt Victoria&mdash;have you
observed that children always have colds and never have
pocket-handkerchiefs?"</p>

<p>Uncle James, however, had a bad cold himself that morning, and described
himself as very much indisposed.</p>

<p>"I went out of doors last night before retiring," he explained at
luncheon, "tempted by the glorious moonlight and the balmy air; but
before I returned the night had changed and become chilly, and
unfortunately the side-door had shut itself, and every one was in bed,
so I could not get in. I threw pebbles up at Grace Mary's window, but
failed to rouse her, she being somewhat deaf. I also knocked and rang,
but no one answered, so I was obliged to shelter in the barn. Harriet,
however, appeared

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
 finally. She&mdash;er&mdash;gets the men's breakfasts,
and&mdash;er&mdash;the kitchen-window&mdash;" But here Uncle James was seized with a
sudden fit of sneezing, and the connection between the men's breakfasts
and the kitchen-window was never explained. "She is an extremely good
girl, is Harriet," he proceeded as soon as he could speak; "up at four
o'clock every morning."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness <i>my</i> trollop was," said Lady Benyon. "She gets later
every day. Where did you go last night?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I had been loitering among the tombs, so to speak," he answered
largely.</p>

<p>Beth was eating cold beef stolidly, but without much appetite because of
her cold, and also because there was hot chicken, and Uncle James had
not given her her choice. Uncle James kept looking at her. He found it
hard to let her alone, but she gave him no cause of offence for some
time. Her little nose was troublesome, however, and at last she sniffed.
Uncle James looked at Lady Benyon.</p>

<p>"Have you observed," he said, "that when a child has a cold she never
has a pocket-handkerchief?"</p>

<p>Beth produced a clean one with a flourish, and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Puck?" Lady Benyon asked, beaming already in
anticipation.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Only I said Uncle James would say that if I sniffed.
Didn't I, Mildred?"</p>

<p>But Mildred, too wary to support her, looked down demurely.</p>

<p>"Puck," said Lady Benyon, "you're a character."</p>

<p>"There are good characters and there are bad characters," Uncle James
moralised.</p>

<p>"Arrah, thin, it isn't a bad character you'd be afther givin' your own
niece," Beth blarneyed; and then she turned up her naughty eyes to the
ceiling and chanted softly: "What will Jimmie-wimmie give his
duckie-dearie to be good? A nice&mdash;sweet&mdash;kiss!"</p>

<p>Uncle James's big white face became suddenly empurpled.</p>

<p>"Gracious! he's swallowed wrong," Lady Benyon exclaimed in alarm. "Drink
something. You really should be careful, a great fat man like you."</p>

<p>Uncle James coughed hard behind his handkerchief, then began to recover
himself. Beth's eyes were fixed on his face. Her chaunt had been a
sudden inspiration, and its effect upon the huge man had somewhat
startled her; but clearly Uncle James was afraid she was going to tell.</p>

<p>"How funny!" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>Uncle James gasped again.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the matter, Puck?" Lady Benyon asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I was just thinking&mdash;thinking I would ask Uncle James to give
Mildred some chicken."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, my dear child!" Uncle James exclaimed, to everybody's
astonishment. "And have some yourself, Beth?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Beth answered. "I'm full."</p>

<p>"Beth!" her mother was beginning, when she perceived that Uncle James
was laughing.</p>

<p>"Now, that child is really amusing," he said&mdash;"<i>really</i> amusing."</p>

<p>No one else thought this last enormity a happy specimen of her wit, and
they looked at Uncle James, who continued to laugh, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Beth," he said, "when luncheon is over I shall give you a
picture-book."</p>

<p>Beth accordingly had to stay behind with him after the others had left
the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Beth," he began in a terrible voice, as soon as they were alone
together, trying to frighten her; "Beth, what were you doing last
night?"</p>

<p>"I was meditating among the tombs," she answered glibly; "but I never
heard them called by that name before."</p>

<p>"You bad child, I shall tell your mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh for shame!" said Beth. "Tell-tale! And if you tell I shall. I saw
you kissing Jenny-penny."</p>

<p>Uncle James collapsed. He had been prepared to explain to Beth that he
had met the poor girl with some rustic lover, and was lecturing her
kindly for her good, and making her go in, which would have made a
plausible story had it not been for that accursed kissing. Of course he
could insist that Beth was lying; the child was known to be imaginative;
but then against that was the emotion he had shown. Lady Benyon had no
very high opinion of him, he knew, and once she obtained a clue she
would soon unravel the truth. No, the only thing was to silence Beth.</p>

<p>"Beth," he said, "I quite agree with you, my dear child. I was only
joking when I said I would tell your mamma. Nothing would induce me to
tell tales out of school."</p>

<p>Beth smiled up at him frankly: "Nor me neither. I don't believe you're
such a bad old boy after all."</p>

<p>Uncle James winced. How he would have liked to throttle her! He
controlled himself, however, and even managed to make a smile as he got
up to leave the room.</p>

<p>"I say, though," Beth exclaimed, seeing him about to depart, "where's
that picture-book?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" he ejaculated. "I had forgotten. But no, Beth, it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> would never do.
If I give it to you now, it would look like a bribe; and I'm sure you
would never accept a bribe."</p>

<p>"I should think not," said Beth.</p>

<p>And it was long years before she understood the mean adroitness of this
last evasion.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span>
 are those who maintain that a man can do everything better than a
woman can do it. This is certainly true of nagging. When a man nags, he
shows his thoroughness, his continuity, and that love of sport which is
the special pride and attribute of his sex. When a man nags, he puts his
whole heart into the effort; a woman only nags, as a rule, because the
heart has been taken out of her. The nagging woman is an over-tasked
creature with jarred nerves, whose plaint is an expression of pain, a
cry for help; in any interval of ease which lasts long enough to relax
the tension, she feels remorse, and becomes amiably anxious to atone.
With the male nag it is different. He is usually sleek and smiling, a
joyous creature, fond of good living, whose self-satisfaction bubbles
over in artistic attempts to make everybody else uncomfortable. This was
the kind of creature Uncle James Patten was. He loved to shock and jar
and startle people, especially if they were powerless to retaliate. Of
two ways of saying a thing he invariably chose the more disagreeable;
and when he had bad news to break, it added to his interest in it if the
victim felt it deeply and showed signs of suffering.</p>

<p>One morning at breakfast it might have been suspected that there was
something unpleasant toward. Uncle James had read prayers with such
happy unction, and showed such pleased importance as he took his seat.</p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria," he lisped, "I have just observed in yesterday's paper
that money matters are in a bad way. There has been a crisis in the
city, and your investments have sunk so low that your income will be
practically nil."</p>

<p>"What!" said Aunt Victoria incredulously, "the shares you advised me to
buy?"</p>

<p>"Those are the ones, yes," he answered.</p>

<p>"But, then&mdash;I fear you have lost money too," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh no, thank you," he assured her, in a tone which implied reproach,
"<i>I</i> never speculate."</p>

<p>"James Patten," said Aunt Victoria quietly, "am I to understand that you
advised me to buy stock in which you yourself did not venture to
speculate?"</p>

"Well&mdash;er&mdash;you see," he answered with composure, "as speculation was
against my principles, I could not take advantage of the opportunity
myself, but that seemed to me no reason why you should not try to double
your income. It may have been an error of judgment on my part; I am far
from infallible&mdash;far from infallible. But I think I may claim to be
disinterested. I did not hope to benefit myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"During my lifetime," Aunt Victoria suggested, in the same tone of quiet
self-restraint. "I see. My modest fortune would not have been much in
itself to a man of your means; but it would have been a considerable sum
if doubled."</p>

<p>"Yes, doubles or quits, doubles or quits," said Uncle James, beaming on
Aunt Victoria as if he were saying something reassuring. "Alas! the
family failing!"</p>

<p>"It is a new departure, however, for the family&mdash;to gamble at other
people's expense," said Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>"Alas! poor human nature," Uncle James philosophised, shaking his head.
"You never know&mdash;you never know."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria looked him straight in the eyes, but made no further show
of emotion, except that she sat more rigidly upright than usual perhaps,
and the rose-tint faded from her delicate face, leaving it waxen-white
beneath her auburn front.</p>

<p>Uncle James ate an egg, with a pious air of thankfulness for the mercies
vouchsafed him.</p>

<p>"And where will you live now, Aunt Victoria?" he asked at last, with an
affectation of as much concern as he could get into his fat voice. For
many years he had insisted that Fairholm was the proper place for his
mother's sister, but then she had had money to leave. "Do not desert us
altogether," he pursued. "You must come and see us as often as your
altered circumstances will admit."</p>

<p>Great-Aunt Victoria Bench bowed expressively. Aunt Grace Mary grew very
red in the face. Mrs. Caldwell seemed to be controlling herself with
difficulty.</p>

<p>"There will be a spare room in my cottage, Aunt Victoria," she said. "I
hope you will consider it your own, and make your home with me."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Caroline," the old lady answered; "but I must
consider."</p>

<p>"It would be a most proper arrangement," Uncle James genially decided;
"and you would have our dear little Beth, of whom you approve, you know,
for an interest in life."</p>

<p>Beth left her seat impulsively, and, going round to the old lady,
nestled up to her, slipped her little hand through her arm, and glared
at Uncle James defiantly.</p>

<p>The old lady's face quivered for a moment, and she patted the child's
hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>But no more was said on the subject in Beth's hearing; only, later, she
found that Aunt Victoria was going to live with them.</p>

<p>Uncle James had suddenly become quite anxious that Mrs. Caldwell should
be settled in her own little house; he said it would be so much more
comfortable for her. The little house was Aunt Grace Mary's property, by
the way&mdash;rent, ten pounds a year; but as it had not been let for a long
time, and it did houses no good to stand empty, Uncle James had
graciously lent it to his sister. When she was so settled in it that it
would be a great inconvenience to move, he asked for the rent.</p>

<p>During the next week he drove every day to the station in Aunt Grace
Mary's pony-carriage, to see if Mrs. Caldwell's furniture had arrived
from Ireland; and when at last it came, he sent every available servant
he had to set the house in order, so that it might be ready for
immediate occupation. He also persuaded Harriet Elvidge, his invaluable
kitchen-maid, to enter Mrs. Caldwell's service as maid-of-all-work.
There is reason to believe that this arrangement was the outcome of
Uncle James's peculiar sense of humour; but Mrs. Caldwell never
suspected it.</p>

<p>"It will be nice for you to have some one I know all about," Uncle James
insisted, "and with a knowledge of cooking besides. And how glad you
will be to sleep under your own roof to-night!" he added in a tone of
kindly congratulation.</p>

<p>"And how glad you will be to get rid of us," said Beth, thus early
giving voice to what other people were only daring to think.</p>

<p>As soon as they were settled in the little bow-windowed house, it became
obvious that there would be differences of opinion between mamma and
Great-Aunt Victoria Bench. They differed about the cooking, about
religion, and about the education of children. Aunt Victoria thought
that if you cooked meat a second time it took all the goodness out of
it. Mrs. Caldwell liked stews, and she said if the joints were
under-done at first, as they should be, re-cooking did <i>not</i> take the
goodness out of the meat; but Aunt Victoria abominated under-done joints
more than anything.</p>

<p>The education of the children was a more serious matter, however&mdash;a
matter of principle, in fact, as opposed to a matter of taste. Mrs.
Caldwell had determined to give her boys a good start in life. In order
to do this on her very limited income, she was obliged to exercise the
utmost self-denial, and even with that, there would be little or nothing
left to spend on the girls. This, however, did not seem to Mrs. Caldwell
to be a matter of much importance. It is customary to sacrifice the
girls of a family to the boys; to give them no educational advantages,
and then to jeer at them for their ignorance and silliness. Mrs.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Caldwell's own education had been of the most desultory character, but
such as it was, she was content with it. "The method has answered in my
case," she complacently maintained, without the slightest suspicion that
the assertion proved nothing but extreme self-satisfaction. Accordingly,
as she could not afford to send her daughters to school as well as the
boys, she decided to educate them herself. Everybody who could read,
write, and cipher was supposed to be able to teach in those days, and
Mrs. Caldwell undertook the task without a doubt of her own capacity.
But Aunt Victoria was not so sanguine.</p>

<p>"I hope religious instruction will be a part of their education," she
said, when the subject was first discussed.</p>

<p>"They shall read the Bible from beginning to end," Mrs. Caldwell
answered shortly.</p>

<p>"That, I should think, would be hardly desirable," Aunt Victoria
deprecated gently.</p>

<p>"And I shall teach them their Catechism, and take them to church," Mrs.
Caldwell proceeded. "That is the way in which <i>I</i> was taught."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> were instructed in doctrine, and taught to order our conduct on
certain fixed principles, which were explained to us," Aunt Victoria
ventured.</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes, I dare say," Mrs. Caldwell observed politely; so there the
subject had to drop.</p>

<p>But Aunt Victoria was far from satisfied. She shook her head sadly over
her niece's spiritual state, and determined to save the souls of her
great-nieces by instructing them herself as occasion should offer.</p>

<p>"What is education, mamma?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Why, learning things, of course," Mrs. Caldwell replied, with a smile
at the child's simplicity.</p>

<p>"I know that," Beth snapped, irritated by her mother's manner.</p>

<p>"Then why did you ask?" Mrs. Caldwell wished to know.</p>

<p>"The child has probably heard that that is not all," said Aunt Victoria.
"'Learning things' is but one item of education&mdash;if you mean by that the
mere acquisition of knowledge. A well-ordered day, for instance, is an
essential part of education. Education is a question of discipline, of
regular hours for everything, from the getting up in the morning to the
going to bed at night. No mind can be properly developed without
routine. Teach a child how to order its time, and its talents will do
the rest."</p>

<p>"Get out your books, children," said Mrs. Caldwell, and Aunt Victoria
hurriedly withdrew.</p>

<p>Beth put a large Bible, Colenso's arithmetic, a French

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>grammar, and
Pinnock (an old-fashioned compilation of questions and answers), on the
table, and looked at them despondently. Then she took a slate, set
herself the easiest addition sum she could find in Colenso, and did it
wrong. Her mother told her to correct it.</p>

<p>"I wish you would show me how, mamma," Beth pleaded.</p>

<p>"You must find out for yourself," her mother answered.</p>

<p>This was her favourite formula. She had no idea of making the lessons
either easy or interesting to the children. Teaching was a duty she
detested, a time of trial both to herself and to her pupils, to be got
over as soon as possible. The whole proceeding only occupied two or
three dreadful hours of the morning, and then the children were free for
the rest of the day, and so was she.</p>

<p>After lessons they all went out together to the north cliffs, where Aunt
Victoria and Mrs. Caldwell walked to and fro on a sheltered terrace,
while the children played on the sands below. It was a still day when
Beth first saw the sands, and the lonely level and the tranquil sea
delighted her. On her left, white cliffs curved round the bay like an
arm; on her right was the grey and solid old stone pile, and behind her
the mellow red brick houses of the little town scrambled up an incline
from the shore irregularly. Silver sparkles brightened the hard smooth
surface of the sand in the sunshine. The tide was coming in, and tiny
waves advanced in irregular curves, and broke with a merry murmur. Joy
got hold of Beth as she gazed about her, feeling the beauty of the
scene. With the infinite charity of childhood, she forgave her mother
her trespasses against her for that day, and her little soul was filled
with the peace of the newly shriven. She flourished a little wooden
spade that Aunt Victoria had given her, but did not dig. The surface of
the sand was all unbroken; no disfiguring foot of man had trodden the
long expanse, and Beth hesitated to be the first to spoil its exquisite
serenity. Her heart expanded, however, and she shouted aloud in a great,
uncontrollable burst of exultation.</p>

<p>A man with a brown beard and moustache, short, crisp, curly hair, and
deep-set, glittering dark grey eyes, came up to her from behind. He wore
a blue pilot-coat, blue trousers, and a peaked cap, the dress of a
merchant-skipper.</p>

<p>"Don't desecrate this heavenly solitude with discordant cries," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Beth had not heard him approach, and she turned round, startled, when he
spoke.</p>

<p>"I thought I was singing!" she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Don't dig and disfigure the beautiful bare brown bosom of the shore,"
he pursued.</p>

<p>"I did not mean to dig," Beth said, looking up in his face;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> and then
looking round about her in perfect comprehension of his mood&mdash;"The
beautiful bare brown bosom of the shore," she slowly repeated,
delighting in the phrase. "It's the kind of thing you can sing, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man, suddenly smiling; "it is pure poetry, and I make
you a present of the copyright."</p>

<p>"But," Beth objected, "the shore is <i>not</i> brown. I've been thinking and
thinking what to call it. It's the colour&mdash;the colour of&mdash;the colour of
tarnished silver," she burst out at last triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Well observed," he said.</p>

<p>"Then I make you a present of the copyright," Beth answered readily.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "but it will not scan."</p>

<p>"What is scan?"</p>

<p>"It won't fit into the verse, you know."</p>

<p>"The beautiful bare colour-of-tarnished-silver bosom of the shore," she
sang out glibly; then agreed, with a wise shake of her head, that the
phrase was impossible; and recurred to another point of interest, as was
her wont&mdash;"What is copyright?"</p>

<p>Before he could answer, however, Mrs. Caldwell had swooped down upon
them. She had seen him from the cliff talking to Beth, and hastened down
the steps in her hot-tempered way, determined to rebuke the man for his
familiarity, and heedless of Aunt Victoria, who had made an effort to
stop her.</p>

<p>"May I ask why you are interfering with my child, sir?" she demanded.</p>

<p>The man in the sailor-suit raised his hat and bowed low.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, madam," he said. "I could not possibly have supposed that
she was your child."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell coloured angrily as at an insult, although the words
seemed innocent enough. When he had spoken, he turned to Beth, with his
hat still in his hand, and added&mdash;"Good-bye, little lady. We must meet
again, you and I&mdash;on the beautiful bare brown bosom of the shore."</p>

<p>Beth's sympathy shone out in a smile, and she waved her hand confidingly
to him as he turned away. Mrs. Caldwell seized her arm and hurried her
up the steps to Aunt Victoria, who stood on the edge of the cliff
blinking calmly.</p>

<p>"Imagine Beth scraping acquaintance with such a common-looking person!"
Mrs. Caldwell cried. "You must never speak to him or look at him
again&mdash;do you hear? I wonder what taste you will develop next!"</p>

<p>"It is a pity that you are so impetuous, Caroline," Aunt Victoria
observed quietly. "That gentleman is the Count

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> Gustav Bartahlinsky, who
may perhaps be considered eccentric here, where noblemen of great
attainments and wealth are certainly not numerous; but is hardly to be
called common-looking."</p>

<p>Beth saw her mother's countenance drop.</p>

<p>"Then I <i>may</i> speak to him," she decided for herself. "What's a
copyright, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother, Beth!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed irritably.</p>

<p>When they went home, Bernadine clamoured for food, and her mother gave
her a piece of bread. They were to have dinner at four o'clock, but no
luncheon, for economy's sake. Beth was hungry too, but she would not
confess it. What she had heard of their poverty had made a deep
impression on her, and she was determined to eat as little as possible.
Aunt Victoria glanced at Bernadine and the bread as she went up to her
room, and Beth fancied she heard her sigh. Was the old lady hungry too,
she wondered, and her little heart sank.</p>

<p>This was Beth's first exercise in self-denial, but she had plenty of
practice, for the scene was repeated day after day.</p>

<p>The children being free, had to amuse themselves as best they could, and
went out to play in the little garden at the back of the house. Mrs.
Caldwell's own freedom was merely freedom for thought. Most of the day
she spent beside the dining-room table, making and mending, her only
distraction being an occasional glance through the window at the boughs
of the apple-trees which showed above the wall opposite, or at the
people passing. Even when teaching the children she made, mended, and
pursued her own thoughts, mapping out careers for her boys, making
brilliant matches for Mildred and Bernadine, and even building a castle
for Beth now and then. She made and mended as badly as might be expected
of a woman whose proud boast it was that when she was married she could
not hem a pocket-handkerchief; and she did it all herself. She had no
notion of utilising the motive-power at hand in the children. As her own
energy had been wasted in her childhood, so she wasted theirs, letting
it expend itself to no purpose instead of teaching them to apply it. She
was essentially a creature of habit. All that she had been taught in her
youth, she taught them; but any accomplishment she had acquired in later
life, she seemed to think that they also should wait to acquire. She had
always dressed for dinner; so now, at half-past three every day, she put
away her work, went into the kitchen for some hot water, which she
carried upstairs herself, called the children, and proceeded to brush
her own hair carefully, and change her dress. She expected the children
to follow her example, but did not pay much attention

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>to their
proceedings, and they, childlike, constantly and consistently shirked as
much of the ceremony as possible. If their mother caught them with
unwashed hands and half-brushed hair, she thumped them on the back, and
made them wash and brush; but she was generally thinking about something
else, and did not catch them. The rite, however, being regularly
although imperfectly performed, resulted in a good habit.</p>

<p>There was another thing too for which Beth had good reason to be
grateful to her mother. During winter, when the days were short, or when
bad weather made it impossible to go out on summer evenings, Mrs.
Caldwell always read aloud to the children after tea till bed-time. Most
mothers would have made the children read; but there was a great deal of
laxity mixed with Mrs. Caldwell's harshness. She found it easier to do
things herself than to make the children do them for her. They objected
to read, and liked to be read to, so she read to them; and as,
fortunately, she had no money to buy children's books, she read what
there were in the house. Beth's ear was still quicker than her eye, and
she would not read to herself if she could help it; but before she was
fourteen, thanks to her mother, she knew much of Scott, Jane Austen,
Dickens, Thackeray, Bulwer Lytton, and even some of Shakespeare, well;
besides such books as "The Woman in White," "The Dead Secret," "Loyal
Heart; or, The Trappers," "The Scalp Hunters," and many more, all of
which helped greatly to develop her intelligence.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span>
 the next two years, Beth continued to look on at life, with eyes
wide open, deeply interested. Her mind at this time, acting without
conscious effort, was a mere photographic apparatus for the registration
of impressions on the brain. Every incident stored and docketed itself
somewhere in her consciousness for future use, and it was upon this
hoard that she drew eventually with such astonishing effect.</p>

<p>Rousseau in "Emile" chose a common capacity to educate, because, he
said, genius will educate itself; but even genius would find its labours
lightened by having been taught the use of some few tools, such as are
supplied by the rudiments of a conventional education. Beth was never
taught anything thoroughly; very few girls were in her day. A woman was
expected at that time to earn her livelihood by marrying a man and
bringing up a family; and, so long as her face was attractive, the fact
that she was ignorant, foolish, and trivial did not, in the estimation
of the average man, at all disqualify her for the task. Beth's
education,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
 at this most impressionable period of her life, consisted in
the acquisition of a few facts which were not made to interest her, and
neither influenced her conduct nor helped to form her character. She
might learn in the morning, for instance, that William the Conqueror
arrived 1066, but the information did not prevent her being as naughty
as possible in the afternoon. One cannot help speculating on how much
she lost or gained by the haphazard of her early training; but one thing
is certain, had the development of her genius depended upon a careful
acquisition of such knowledge as is to be had at school, it must have
remained latent for ever.</p>

<p>As it was, however, being forced out into the life-school of the world,
she there matriculated on her own account, and so, perhaps, saved her
further faculty from destruction. For theoretical knowledge would have
dulled the keenness of her insight probably, confused her point of view,
and brought in accepted commonplaces to spoil the originality of her
conclusions. It was from practical experience of life rather than from
books that she learnt her work; she saw for herself before she came
under the influence of other people's observations; and this was
doubtless the secret of her success; but it involved the cruel necessity
of a hard and strange apprenticeship. From the time of their arrival in
Rainharbour she lived three lives a day&mdash;the life of lessons and
coercion which was forced upon her, an altogether artificial and
unsatisfactory life; the life she took up the moment she was free to act
for herself; and a life of endless dreams, which mingled with the other
two unwholesomely. For the rich soil of her mind, left uncultivated, was
bound to bring forth something, and because there was so little seed
sown in it, the crop was mostly weeds.</p>

<p>When we review the march of events which come crowding into a life,
seeing how few it is possible to describe, no one can wonder that there
is talk of the difficulty of selection. Who, for instance, could have
supposed that a good striped jacket Jim had outgrown, and Mrs.
Caldwell's love of grey, would have had much effect upon Beth's career?
And yet these trifles were epoch-making. Mrs. Caldwell thought grey a
ladylike colour, and therefore bought Beth a carmelite dress of a
delicate shade for the summer. For the first few weeks the dress was a
joy to Beth, but after that it began to be stained by one thing and
another, and every spot upon it was a source of misery, not only because
she was punished for messing the dress, but also because she had messed
it; for she was beginning to be fastidious about her clothes; and every
time she went out she was conscious of those unsightly stains, and
fancied everybody was looking at them. She had to wear the frock,
however, for want of another; and in the autumn, when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> the days began to
be chilly, a cast-off jacket of Jim's was added to the affliction. Mrs.
Caldwell caught her trying it on one day, and after shaking her for
doing so, she noticed that the jacket fitted her, and the bright idea of
making Beth wear it out, so that it might not be wasted, occurred to
her. To do her justice, Mrs. Caldwell had no idea of the torture she was
inflicting upon Beth by forcing her to appear in her soiled frock and a
boy's jacket. The poor lady was in great straits at the time, and had
nothing to spend on her daughters, because her sons were growing up, and
beginning to clamour for pocket-money. Their mother considered it right
that they should have it too; and so the tender, delicate, sensitive
little girl had to go dirty and ashamed in order that her brothers might
have the wherewithal to swing a cane, smoke, drink beer, play billiards,
and do all else that makes boys men in their own estimation at an early
age.</p>

<p>Rainharbour was little more than a fishing village in those days, though
it became a fashionable watering-place in a very few years. When Mrs.
Caldwell first settled there, a whole codfish was sold for sixpence,
fowls were one-and-ninepence a pair, eggs were almost given away, and
the manners of the people were in keeping with the low prices. The
natives had no idea of concealing their feelings, and were in the habit
of expressing their opinions of each other and things in general at the
top of their voices in the open street. They were as conservative as the
Chinese too, and thought anything new and strange ridiculous.
Consequently, when a little girl appeared amongst them in a boy's
jacket, they let her know that they resented the innovation.</p>

<p>"She's getten a lad's jacket on! oh! oh! she's getten a lad's jacket
on!" the children called aloud after her in the street, while their
mothers came to the cottage-doors, wiping soap-suds from their arms, and
stood staring as at a show; and even the big bland sailors lounging on
the quay expanded into broad grins or solemnly winked at one another.
Beth flushed with shame, but her courageous little heart was instantly
full of fight. "What ignorant people these are!" she exclaimed
haughtily, turning to Bernadine, who had dropped behind out of the
obloquy. "What ignorant people these are! they know nothing of the
fashions." The insinuation stung her persecutors, but that only made
them the more offensive, and wherever she went she was jeered at&mdash;openly
if there were no grown-up person with her, covertly if there were, but
always so that she understood. After that first explosion she used to
march along with an air of calm indifference as if she heard nothing,
but she had to put great constraint upon herself in order to seem
superior while feeling deeply humiliated; and all the time she suffered
so acutely that at last she could hardly be induced to go out at all.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell, who never noticed the "common people" enough to be aware
of their criticism, would not listen to anything Beth had to say on the
subject, and considered that her objection to go out in the jacket was
merely another instance of her tiresome obstinacy. Punishments ensued,
and Beth had the daily choice whether she should be scolded and beaten
for refusing to go out, or be publicly jeered at for wearing a "lad's
jacket."</p>

<p>Sometimes she preferred the chance of public derision to the certainty
of private chastisement; but oftener she took the chastisement. This
state of things could not last much longer, however. Hitherto her mother
had ruled her by physical force, but now their wills were coming into
collision, and it was inevitable that the more determined should carry
her point.</p>

<p>"Go and put your things on directly, you naughty, obstinate child," her
mother screamed at her one day. Beth did not move.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>Beth made no sign. And suddenly Mrs. Caldwell realised that if Beth
would not go out, she could not make her. She never thought of trying to
persuade her. All that occurred to her was that Beth was too big to be
carried or pulled or pushed; that she might be hurt, but could not be
frightened; and that there was nothing for it, therefore, but to let her
have her own way.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Mrs. Caldwell, "I shall go without you. But
you'll be punished for your wickedness some day, you'll see, and then
you'll be sorry."</p>

<p>Mildred had gone to be educated by a rich sister of her father's by this
time, Aunt Victoria and Bernadine usually went out with Mrs. Caldwell,
so it came to pass that Beth began to be left pretty much to her own
resources, of which Harriet Elvidge in the kitchen was one, and a
considerable one.</p>

<p>Harriet was a woman of well-marked individuality and brilliant
imagination. She could never separate fact from fiction in any form of
narrative, and narrative was her speciality. She was always recounting
something. Beth used to follow her from room to room, as she went about
her work, listening with absolute faith and the deepest interest to the
stream of narrative which flowed on without interruption, no matter what
Harriet was doing. Sometimes, when she was dusting the drawing-room
mantelpiece, she would pause with a china cup in one hand and her duster
in the other, to emphasise a thrilling incident, or make a speech
impressive with suitable gesticulation; and sometimes, for the same
purpose, she would stop with her hand on the yellowstone with which she
was rubbing the kitchen-hearth, and her head in the grate almost. Often,
too, Beth in her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
 eager sympathy would say, "Let me do that!" and
Harriet would sit in an arm-chair if they were in the drawing-room, and
resign the duster&mdash;or the dishcloth, if they were in the kitchen&mdash;and
continue the recital, while Beth showed her appreciation, and encouraged
her to proceed, by doing the greater part of her work for her. Mrs.
Caldwell never could make out why Beth's hands were in such a state.
"They are all cracked and begrimed," she would exclaim, "as if the child
had to do dirty work like a servant!" And it was a good thing for Beth
that she did it, for otherwise she would have had no physical training
at all, and would have suffered as her sister Mildred did for want of
it. Mildred, unlike Beth, held her head high, and never forgot that she
was a young lady by right of descent, with an hereditary aptitude for
keeping her inferiors in their proper place. She only went into the
kitchen of necessity, and would never have dreamed of dusting, sweeping,
bed-making, or laying the table, to help the servant, however much she
might have been over-tasked; neither would Harriet have dared to
approach her with the familiar pleading: "I say, miss, 'elp uz, I'm that
done," to which Beth so readily responded. Mildred was studious; she had
profited by the good teaching she had had while her father was alive,
and was able to "make things out" for herself; but she cultivated her
mind at the expense of her body. She was one of those delicate, nervous,
sensitive girls, whose busy brains require the rest of regular manual
exercise; and for want of it, she lived upon books, and very literally
died of them eventually. She was naturally, so to speak, an artificial
product of conventional ideas; Beth, on the contrary, was altogether a
little human being, but one of those who answer to expectation with
fatal versatility. She liked blacking grates, and did them well, because
Harriet told her she could; she hated writing copies, and did them
disgracefully, because her mother beat her for a blot, and said she
would never improve. For the same reason, long before she could read
aloud to her mother intelligibly, she had learnt all that Harriet could
teach her, not only of the house-work, but of the cooking, from cleaning
a fish and trussing a fowl to making barley-broth and puff-pastry.
Harriet was a good cook if she had the things, as she said herself,
having picked up a great deal when she was kitchen-maid in Uncle James's
household.</p>

<p>Harriet was the daughter of a labourer. Her people lived at a village
some miles away, and every Saturday morning a carrier with a covered
cart brought her a letter from home, and a little parcel containing a
cheesecake or some other dainty. Beth took a lively interest both in the
cheesecake and the letter. "What's the news from home to-day?" she would
ask. "How's Annie,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
 and what has mother sent?" Whereupon Harriet would
share the cheesecake with her, and read the letter aloud, work being
suspended as long as possible for the purpose.</p>

<p>Harriet was about twenty-five at this time. She had very black silky
hair, straight and heavy, parted in the middle, drawn down over her
ears, and gathered up in a knot behind. Her face was oval, forehead
high, eyebrows arched and delicate, nose straight, and she had large
expressive dark grey eyes, rather deeply set, with long black lashes,
and a mouth that would have been handsome of the sensual full-lipped
kind, had it not been distorted by a burn, which had disfigured her
throat and chin as well. She had set her pinafore on fire when she was a
child, and it had blazed up under her chin, causing irreparable injury
before the flames could be extinguished. But for that accident she would
have been a singularly good-looking woman of a type which was common in
books of beauty at the beginning of this reign.</p>

<p>She could read and write after a fashion, and was intelligent, but
ignorant, deceitful, superstitious, and hysterical. Mrs. Caldwell
continually lectured Beth about going into the kitchen so much; but she
only lectured on principle really. Young ladies could not be allowed to
associate with servants as a rule, but an exception might be made in the
case of a good, steady, sober sort of person, such as Mrs. Caldwell
believed Harriet to be, who would keep the troublesome child out of
mischief, and do her no harm. Harriet, as it happened, delighted in
mischief, and was often the instigator; but Mrs. Caldwell might be
excused for not suspecting this, as she only saw her on her best
behaviour. When the children were safe in bed, and Miss Victoria Bench,
who was an early person, had also retired, Harriet would put on a clean
apron, and appear before Mrs. Caldwell in the character of a
respectable, vigilant domestic, more anxious about her mistress's
interests than her own; and she would then make a report in which Beth
figured as a fiend of a child who could not be trusted alone for a
moment, and Harriet herself as a conscientious custodian, but for whom
nobody knows what might have happened.</p>

<p>When Harriet had no particular incident to report at these secret
conferences, she would tell Mrs. Caldwell her dreams, and describe signs
and portents of coming events which she had observed during the day; and
Mrs. Caldwell would listen with interest. Superstition is a subject on
which the most class-proud will consult with the lowest and the
wickedest; it is a mighty leveller downwards. But the poor lady had a
lonely life. It was not Mrs. Caldwell's fault, but the fault of her day,
that she was not a noble woman. She belonged to early Victorian times,
when every effort was made to mould the characters of women as the homes
of the period were built, on lines of ghastly uniformity.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> The education
of a girl in those days was eminently calculated to cloud her
intelligence and strengthen every failing developed in her sex by ages
of suppression. Mrs. Caldwell was a plastic person, and her mind had
been successfully compressed into the accustomed groove until her
husband came and helped it to escape a little in one or two
directions&mdash;with the effect, however, of spoiling its conventional
symmetry without restoring its natural beauty. If the mind be
tight-laced long enough, it is ruined as a model, just as the body is;
and throwing off the stays which restrained it, merely exposes its
deformities without remedying them; so that there is nothing for the old
generation but to remain in stays. Mrs. Caldwell, with all her
deformities, was just as heroic as she knew how to be. She lived for her
children to the extent of denying herself the bare necessaries of life
for them; and bore poverty and obscurity of a galling kind without a
murmur. She scarcely ever saw a soul to speak to. Uncle James Patten and
the Benyon family did not associate much with the townspeople, and were
not popular in the county; so that Mrs. Caldwell had very few visitors.
Of course it was an advantage to be known as a relation of the great
people of the place, although the great people had a bad name; but then
she was evidently a poor relation, which made it almost a virtue to
neglect her in a community of Christians who only professed to love the
Lord Himself for what they could get. "You must worship God because He
can give you everything," was what they taught their children. Even the
vicar of the parish would not call on anybody with less than five
hundred a year. He kept a school for boys, which paid him more than
cent. per cent., but did nothing for his parishioners except preach
sermons an hour long on Sundays. Self-denial and morality were his
favourite subjects. He had had three wives himself, and was getting
through a fourth as fast as one baby a year would do it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell, left to herself, found her evenings especially long and
dreary. It was her habit to write her letters then, and read,
particularly in French and Italian, which, she had some vague notion,
helped to improve her mind. But she often wearied for a word, and began
to hear voices herself in the howling winter winds, and to brood upon
the possible meaning of her own dreams, and to wonder why a solitary
rook flew over her house in particular, and cawed twice as it passed.
Little things naturally become of great importance in such a life, and
Harriet kept up the supply; she being the connecting link between Mrs.
Caldwell and the outer world. She knew all that was happening in the
place, and she claimed to know all that was going to happen; and by
degrees the mistress as well as the maid fell into the way of comparing
events with the forebodings

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
 which had preceded them, and often
established a satisfactory connection between the two.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell always made coffee in the kitchen for breakfast in the
morning, and while she was so engaged, Harriet, busy making toast, would
begin&mdash;"Did you 'ear a noise last night, m'em?"</p>

<p>"No, Harriet&mdash;at least&mdash;was it about ten o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'em, just about&mdash;a sort of scraping rattling noise, like a lot of
people walking over gravel."</p>

<p>"I did hear something of the kind. I wonder what it was," Mrs. Caldwell
would rejoin.</p>

<p>"Well, m'em, I think it means there are people coming to the 'ouse, for
I remember it 'appened the night before your brother come, m'em,
unexpected, and the lawyer."</p>

<p>If nobody came during the day, the token would be supposed to refer to
some future period; and so, by degrees, signs and portents took the
place of more substantial interests in Mrs. Caldwell's dreary life. Such
things were in the air, for the little seaside place was quite out of
the world at the time, and the people still had more faith in an
incantation than a doctor's dose. If an accident happened, or a storm
decimated the fishing-fleet, signs innumerable were always remembered
which had preceded the event. If you asked why nobody had profited by
the warning, people would shake their heads and tell you it was to be;
and if you asked what was the use of the warning then, they would say to
break the blow&mdash;in which idea there seemed to be some sense.</p>

<p>"When they told Tom's wife 'e was drownded, she'd 'a' dropped down dead
'erself and left the children, if she 'adn't 'a' knowed it all along,"
Harriet explained to Beth. "Eh! lass, you mark my words, warnin's comes
for one thing, and warnin's comes for another, but they always comes for
good, an' you're forced to take notice an' act on 'em or you're forced
to leave 'em alone, just as is right, an' ye can't 'elp it yerself,
choose 'ow. There's Mrs. Pettinger, she dreamed one night 'er husband's
boat was lost, an' next mornin' 'e was to go out fishin', but she
wouldn't let 'im. 'No, 'Enery John,' she ses, 'you'll not go, not if ah
'as to 'old you,' ses she, an' 'e was that mad 'e struck 'er an' knocked
'er down an' broke 'er arm, an' then, needs must, 'e 'ad to fetch the
doctor to set it, an' by the time that was done, the boat 'ad gone
wi'out 'im. The other men thought 'e was drunk&mdash;'e often was&mdash;an' they
wouldn't wait. Well, that boat never came back."</p>

<p>"And did he beat his wife again?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, 'ow could it make any difference?" Harriet answered.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth was fascinated by the folk-lore of the place, and soon surpassed
Harriet herself in the interpretation of dreams and the reading of signs
and tokens. She began to invent methods of divination for herself too,
such as, "If the boards don't creak when I walk across the room I shall
get through my lessons without trouble this morning," a trick which soon
became a confirmed habit into which she was apt to lapse at any time;
and so persistent are these early impressions that to the end of her
days she would always rather have seen two rooks together than one
alone, rooks being the birds of omen in a land where magpies were
scarce. Mrs. Caldwell knew nothing of Beth's proficiency in the black
arts. She would never have discussed such a subject before the children,
and took it for granted that Harriet was equally discreet; while Beth on
her part, with her curious quick sense of what was right and proper,
believed her mother to be above such things.</p>

<p>Harriet was a person of varied interests, all of which she discussed
with Beth impartially. She had many lovers, according to her own
account, and was stern and unyielding with them all, and so particular
that she would dismiss them at any moment for nothing almost. If she
went out at night she had always much to tell the next morning, and Beth
would hurry over her lessons, watch her mother out of the way, and slip
into the kitchen or upstairs after Harriet, and question her about what
she had said, and he had said, and if she had let him kiss her even
once.</p>

<p>"Well, last night," Harriet said on one occasion, in a tone of apology
for her own weakness and good-nature. "Last night I couldn't 'elp it. 'E
just put 'is arm round me, and, well, there! I was sorry for 'im."</p>

<p>"Why don't you say <i>he</i> and <i>him</i> and <i>his</i>, Harriet?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"No, you don't. You say 'e and 'im and 'is."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what you say."</p>

<p>Beth shouted the aspirates at her for answer, but in vain; with all the
will in the world to "talk fine," as she called it, Harriet could never
acquire the art, for want of an ear to hear. She could not perceive the
slightest difference between him and 'im.</p>

<p>Even at this age Beth had her own point of view in social matters, and
frequently disconcerted Harriet by a word or look or inflection of the
voice which expressed disapproval of her conduct. Harriet had been at
home on one occasion for a week's holiday, a charwoman having done her
work in her absence, and on her return she had much to relate of Charles
Russell, the groom at Fairholm, who continued to be an ardent

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> admirer
of hers, but not an honourable one, because he did not realise what a
very superior person Harriet was. He thought she was no better than
other girls, and when they were sitting up one night together in her
mother's cottage, the rest of the family having gone to bed, he made her
a proposal which Harriet indignantly rejected.</p>

<p>"And ah <i>ses</i> to 'im, 'Charles <i>Russell</i>,' ah ses to 'im, 'not was it
ever so,' ah ses to 'im"&mdash;she was proceeding emphatically when Beth
interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Did you say you sat up with him alone all night?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's no 'arm, you know," Harriet answered on the defensive,
without precisely knowing why.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say?" Beth rejoined without comment.</p>

<p>But Harriet, put out of countenance, omitted the details, and brought
the story to an abrupt conclusion.</p>

<p>Another of Harriet's interests in life was the <i>Family Herald</i>, which
she took regularly, and as regularly read aloud to Beth, to the best of
her ability&mdash;from the verses to "Violet," or "My own Love," on the first
page, to the "Random Readings" on the last. They laughed at the jokes,
tried to guess the riddles, were impressed with the historical anecdotes
and words of wisdom, and became so hungry over the recipes for good
dishes that they frequently fried eggs and potatoes, or a slice stolen
from the joint roasting at the fire, and feasted surreptitiously.</p>

<p>Beth tried in after years to remember what the stories in the <i>Family
Herald</i> had been about, but all she could recall was a vague incident of
a falling scaffold, of a heroine called Margaret taking refuge in the
dark behind a hoarding, and of a fascinating hero whom Harriet called Ug
Miller. Long afterwards it dawned upon Beth that his name was Hugh.</p>

<p>When Mildred went to her aunt, Beth and Bernadine became of necessity
constant companions, and it was a curious kind of companionship, for
their natures were antagonistic. Like rival chieftains whose territories
adjoin, they professed no love for each other, and were often at war,
but were intimate nevertheless, and would have missed each other,
because there was no one else with whom they could so conveniently
quarrel. Harriet took the liveliest interest in their squabbles, which,
under her able direction, rapidly developed from the usual little girls'
scrimmages into regular stand-up fights.</p>

<p>One day Beth pulled Bernadine's hair passionately, and Bernadine
retaliated by clawing Beth's face, and then howled as a further relief
to her feelings. Mrs. Caldwell rushed to see what accident had happened
to the dear child, and Harriet came to see the sport.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, Beth pulled my hair," Bernadine whined.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell immediately thumped Beth, who seldom said a word in her
own defence. Harriet was neutral till her mistress had disappeared, and
then she supported Beth.</p>

<p>"Just you wait till after dinner," she said. "Come into the kitchen when
your ma's asleep, and fight it out. Don't you be put upon by
tell-pie-tits."</p>

<p>"What's the use of my going into the kitchen?" Beth rejoined; "Bernadine
doesn't fight fair. She's a horrid, low little coward."</p>

<p>"Am I!" Bernadine howled. "Just you wait till after dinner! I'm as brave
as you are, and as strong, though you <i>are</i> the biggest." Which was
true. Bernadine was sallow, thin, wiry, and muscular; Beth was soft, and
round, and white. She had height, age, and weight on her side; Bernadine
had strength, agility, and cunning.</p>

<p>"Phew&mdash;w&mdash;w!" Beth jeered, mimicking her whine. "You'd 'tell mamma' if
you got a scratch."</p>

<p>"I won't, Beth, if you'll fight," Bernadine protested.</p>

<p>"We'll see after dinner," Harriet put in significantly, and then
returned to her work.</p>

<p>After the four o'clock dinner, during the dark winter months, Mrs.
Caldwell dozed for half-an-hour in her chair by the fire. This was the
children's opportunity. They were supposed to sit still and amuse
themselves quietly while their mother slept; and, until she slept, they
would sit motionless, watching her, the greater their anxiety to get
away the more absolute their silence. Mrs. Caldwell looked as if she
were being mesmerised to sleep by the two pairs of bright eyes so
resolutely and patiently fixed upon her. The moment her breathing showed
she was sound asleep, the children stole to the kitchen, shutting the
doors after them softly, and instantly set to work.</p>

<p>It was a gruesome sight, those two children, with teeth set and clenched
fists, battering each other in deadly earnest, but with no noise save
the fizzle of feet on the brick floor, an occasional thump up against a
piece of furniture, or the thud when they fell. They were afraid to
utter a sound lest Aunt Victoria, up in her room, should hear them, and
come down interfering; or their mother should wake, and come out and
catch them. They bruised and blackened and scratched each other, and
were seldom without what they considered the honourable scars of these
battles. Sometimes, when Bernadine was badly mauled, she lost her
temper, and threatened to tell mamma. But Beth could always punish her,
and did so, by refusing to fight next time, although, without that
recreation, life were a blank.</p>

<p>Harriet always cleared away obstacles to give them room, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> then sat
down to eat her dinner, and watch the fight. She had the tastes, and
some of the habits, of a Roman empress, and encouraged them with the
keenest interest for a long time, but when she had finished her dinner
she usually wearied of the entertainment, and would then stop it.</p>

<p>"I say, yer <i>ma's</i> comin'! I can 'ear 'er!" she would exclaim. "'Elp us
to wash up, or I shan't be done for the reading."</p>

<p>When Harriet wanted help, Bernadine usually slipped away, helping
anybody not being much in her line; but Beth set to work with a will.</p>

<p>Beth, always sociable, had persuaded her mother to let Harriet come to
the reading; and Harriet accordingly, in a clean cap and apron, with a
piece of sewing, was added to the party.</p>

<p>So long as she sat on a high chair, at a respectful distance, and
remembered that she was a servant, her being there rather gratified Mrs.
Caldwell than otherwise, once she had yielded to Beth's persuasion, and
saw the practical working of the experiment; it made her feel as if she
were doing something to improve the lower classes. It was a pity she did
not try to improve Beth and Bernadine by finding some sewing for their
idle hands to do. During the reading, dear little Bernadine, "so good
and affectionate always," would sit on the floor beside her mother,
whose pocket she often picked of a penny or sixpence to vary the
monotony when she did not understand the book. Beth also sat idle,
listening intently, and watching her sister. If the reading had been
harrowing or exciting, she would fight Bernadine for the sixpence when
they went to bed. There were lively scenes during the readings. They all
wept at the pathetic parts, laughed loudly when amused, and disputed
about passages and incidents at the top of their voices. Mrs. Caldwell
forgot that Harriet was a servant, Harriet forgot herself, and the
children, unaccustomed to wordy warfare, forgot their fear of their
mother, and flew at each other's throats.</p>

<p>When the story was very interesting, Mrs. Caldwell read until she was
hoarse, and then went on to herself&mdash;"dipping," the children called it.
It was a point of honour with them not to dip, and they would
remonstrate with their mother loudly when they caught her at it. Their
feeling on the subject was so strong that she was ashamed to be seen
dipping at last. She used to put the book away until they were safe in
bed, and then gratify her curiosity; but they suspected her, because
once or twice they noticed that she was unaffected by an exciting part;
so one night they came down in their night-dresses and caught her, and
after that the poor lady had to be careful. She might thump the children
for coming downstairs, but she could not alter the low opinion they had
of a person who dipped.

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth's</span> brain began to be extraordinarily busy.
She recorded nothing, but
her daily doings were so many works of her imagination. She was
generally somebody else in these days, seldom herself; and people who
did not understand this might have supposed that she was an exceedingly
mendacious little girl, when she was merely speaking consistently in the
character which she happened to be impersonating. She would spend hours
of the afternoon alone in the drawing-room, standing in the window
looking out while she wove her fancies; and she soon began to go out
also, by the back-door, when the mood was upon her, without asking
anybody's leave. She had wandered off in this way on one occasion to the
south side, whither her people rarely went. At the top of the cliff,
where the winding road began which led down to the harbour, a paralysed
sailor was sitting in a wickerwork wheeled chair, looking over the sea.
Beth knew the man by sight. He had been a yachtsman in the service of
one of her great-uncles, and she had heard hints of extraordinary
adventures they had had together. It filled her with compassion to see
him sitting there so lonely and helpless, and as she approached she
resolved herself into a beneficent being, able and willing to help. She
had a book under her arm, a costly volume which Mrs. Caldwell had
borrowed to read to the children. Beth had been looking at the pictures
when the desire to go out suddenly seized upon her, and had carried the
book off inadvertently.</p>

<p>"How are you to-day, Tom?" she said, going up to the invalid
confidently. "I'm glad to see you out. We shall soon have you about
again as well as ever. I knew a man in Ireland much worse than you are.
He couldn't move his hands and arms. Legs are bad enough, but when it's
hands and arms as well, you know, it's worse. Well, now you couldn't
tell there'd ever been anything the matter with him."</p>

<p>"And what cured 'im?" Tom asked with interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, he just <i>thought</i> he'd get well, you know. You've got to set
yourself that way, don't you see? If mountains can be moved by faith,
you can surely move your own legs!"</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable any way," Tom ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Do you like reading?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Yes, I read a bit at times."</p>

<p>"Well, I've brought you a book," Beth proceeded, handing him the
borrowed volume. "You'll find it interesting, I'm sure. It's a great
favourite of mine."</p>

<p>"You're mighty good," the sailor said.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, not at all," Beth answered largely. Then she wished him good-bye.
But she often visited him again in the same character, and the stories
she told that unhappy invalid for his comfort and encouragement were
amazing. When the book was missed, and her mother bothered about it, she
listened serenely, and even helped to look for it.</p>

<p>Beth strolled homewards when she left her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and on the way she
became Norna of the Fitful Head. She tried Minna and Brenda first, but
these characters were too insipid for her taste. Norna was different.
She did things, you know, and made charms, and talked poetry, and people
were afraid of her. Beth believed in her thoroughly. She'd be Norna, and
make charms. But she had no lead. Norna looked about her. She knew by
magic that Cleveland was coming to consult her, and she had no lead.
There was a border of lead, however, over the attic window outside. All
she had to do was to steal upstairs, climb out of the window on to the
roof, and cut a piece of the lead off. It was now the mystic moment to
obtain lead, but she must be wary. She strolled through the kitchen in a
casual way. Harriet was busy about the grate, and paid no attention to
her; so she secured the carving-knife without difficulty, went up to the
attic, and opened the window. She was now on the dangerous pinnacle of a
temple, risking her life in order to obtain the materials for a charm
which would give her priceless power.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street, there lived in the Orchard House
another widow-woman with three daughters. She let lodgings, and was
bringing up her children to honest industry in that state of life. She
and Mrs. Caldwell took a kindly interest in each other's affairs. Mrs.
Davy happened to be changing the curtains in front that afternoon when
Beth crept out of the attic window on to the roof, and she was paralysed
with horror for a moment, expecting to see the child roll off into the
street. She was a sensible woman, however, and quickly recovering
herself, she ran across the road, with her spectacles on, and rapped at
Mrs. Caldwell's door. Beth, hacking away at the lead with the
carving-knife, did not heed the rap. Presently, however, she heard
hurried footsteps on the stairs, and climbed back into the attic
incontinently, putting her spoils in her pocket. When Mrs. Davy, her
mother, and Harriet, all agitated, burst open the door, she was standing
at the window looking out tranquilly.</p>

<p>"What were you doing on the roof, Beth?" her mother demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Davy says she saw you get out of the window."</p>

<p>Beth was silent.</p>

<p>"You're a bad girl, giving your mother so much trouble,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> Mrs. Davy
exclaimed, looking at her under her spectacles sternly. "If you was my
child I'd whack you, I would."</p>

<p>Beth was instantly a lady, sneering at this common woman who was taking
a liberty which she knew her mother would resent as much as she did.</p>

<p>"And what were you doing with the carving-knife, Miss Beth?" cried
Harriet, spying it on the floor, and picking it up. Criminals are only
clever up to a certain point; Beth had forgotten to conceal the
carving-knife. "Oh dear! oh dear! If you 'aven't 'acked it all the way
along!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" Mrs. Caldwell echoed. It was her best carving-knife,
and Beth would certainly have been beaten if Mrs. Davy had not suggested
it. As it was, however, Mrs. Caldwell controlled her temper, and merely
ordered her to go downstairs immediately. In the management of her
children she would not be dictated to by anybody.</p>

<p>This was Beth's first public appearance as a disturber of the peace, and
the beginning of the bad name she earned for herself in certain circles
eventually. But she was let off lightly for it. Mrs. Caldwell's
punishments were never retrospective. She was thunder and lightning in
her wrath; a flash and then a bang, and it was all over. If she missed
the first movement, the culprit escaped. She could no more have punished
one of her children in cold blood than she could have cut its throat.</p>

<p>Beth ran down to the acting-room, so called because the boys had brought
home the idea of acting in the holidays, and they had got up charades
there on a stage made of boxes, with an old counterpane for a curtain,
and farthing candles for footlights. It was a long, narrow room over the
kitchen, with a sloping roof. Three steps led down into it. There was a
window at one end, a small lattice with an iron bar nailed to the
outside vertically. Beth swung herself out round the bar, dropped on to
the back-kitchen roof, crept across the tiles to the chimney at the far
corner, stepped thence on to the top of the old wooden pump, and from
the top to the spout, from the spout to the stone trough, and so into
the garden. Then she ran round to the kitchen, and got a candle, a
canister, and some water in a pail, all of which she took up to the
acting-room by way of the back-kitchen roof. The canister happened to
contain allspice, but this was not to be considered when she wanted the
canister, so she emptied it from the roof on to Harriet's head as she
happened to be passing, and so got some good out of it, for Harriet
displayed strong feeling on the subject both at the moment and
afterwards, when she was trying to get the stuff out of her hair; which
interested Beth, who in some such way often surprised people into the
natural expression of emotions which she might never

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> otherwise have
discovered. Bernadine had been playing alone peaceably in the garden,
but Beth persuaded her to come upstairs. She found Beth robed in the old
counterpane, with her hair dishevelled, and the room darkened. Beth was
Norna now in her cell on the Fitful Head, and Bernadine was the
shrinking but resolute Minna come to consult her. Beth made her sit
down, drew a magic circle round her with a piece of chalk, and, in a
deep tragic voice, warned her not to move if she valued her life, for
there were evil spirits in the room. The pail stood on a box draped with
an old black shawl, and round this she also drew a circle. Then she put
some lead in the canister, melted it over the candle, dropped it into
the water, and muttered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like snakes the molten metal hisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Curses come instead of kisses."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She plunged her hand into the water&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I search a harp for harmony,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But daggers only do I see;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I search a heart for love and hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But find a ghastly hangman's rope.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Woe! Woe!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Three times round the pail she went, moaning, groaning, writhing her
body, and wringing her hands&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Woe! Woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy courage will be sorely tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt not be the pirate's bride."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At this Bernadine, whose nerves were completely shaken, set up such a
howl that Harriet came running to see what was the matter. She soon let
light into the acting-room. Mrs. Caldwell and Aunt Victoria had gone to
see Aunt Grace Mary, so Harriet was in charge of the children, and to
save herself further trouble, she took them up to a black-hole there was
without a window at the top of the house, and locked them in. The place
was quite empty, so that they could do no harm, and they did not seem to
mind being locked up. Harriet intended to give them a little fright and
then let them out; but, being busy, she forgot them, and when at last
she remembered, it was so dark she had to take a candle; and great was
her horror, on opening the door, to see both children stretched out on
the bare boards side by side, apparently quite dead. One glance at their
ghastly faces was enough for Harriet. She just looked and then fled,
shrieking, with the candle alight in her hand, right out into the
street. Several people who happened to be passing at the time stopped to
see what was the matter. Harriet's talent for fiction furnished

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> her
with a self-saving story on the instant. She said the children had shut
themselves up and got smothered.</p>

<p>"We'd better go and see if there's nothing can be done," a respectable
workman suggested.</p>

<p>Harriet led the way, about a dozen people following, all awe-stricken
and silent. When they came to the door, they peeped in over each other's
shoulders at the two poor children, stretched out stiff and stark, the
colour of death, their jaws dropped, their glazed eyes shining between
the half-closed lids, a piteous spectacle.</p>

<p>"Just let's see the candle a moment," the workman said. He took it from
Harriet, and entered stooping&mdash;the place was a mere closet just under
the roof, and he could not stand upright in it. He peered into the
children's faces, then knelt down beside them, and felt their arms and
chests. Suddenly he burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"You little devils," he said, "what 'a' ye done this for?"</p>

<p>Beth sat up. "Harriet locked us in to give us a fright, so we thought
we'd frighten Harriet," she said.</p>

<p>The walls were whitewashed, and the children had made themselves ghastly
by rubbing their faces all over with the whitening.</p>

<p>"You've getten yer 'ands full wi' them two, I'm thinkin', missis," the
workman remarked to Harriet as he went off chuckling.</p>

<p>"Did you hear, Beth?" Bernadine complained; "he called us little
devils."</p>

<p>"All right," Beth answered casually. But Bernadine was disgusted. She
was one of those pious children who like to stand high in the estimation
of the grown-up people; and she disapproved of Beth's conduct when it
got her into trouble. She was like the kind of man who enjoys being
vicious so long as he is not found out by any one who will think the
less of him for it; when he is found out he excuses himself, and blames
his associates. Bernadine never resisted Beth's eloquent persuasions,
nor the luring fascination of her schemes; but when she had had her full
share of the pleasures of naughtiness, and was tired and cross, her
conscience smote her, and then she told mamma. This did her good, and
got Beth punished, which made Bernadine feel that she had expiated her
own naughtiness and been forgiven, and also made her feel sorry for
Beth&mdash;a nice kind feeling, which she always enjoyed.</p>

<p>Beth despised her for her conscientious treachery, and retaliated by
tempting her afresh. One day she lured her out on to the tiles through
an attic window in the roof, at the back of the house. It would be such
fun to sit astride on the roof-ridge, and look right down into the
street, she said, and across Mrs. Davy's orchard to the fields on that
side, and out to sea on the other.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"And things will come into our minds up there&mdash;such lovely things," she
proceeded, beguiling Bernadine to distract her attention as she helped
her up. When they were securely seated, Bernadine began to grumble.</p>

<p>"Things don't come into my mind," she whined.</p>

<p>"Don't they? Why, I was just thinking if we were to fall we should
certainly be killed," Beth answered cheerfully. "We should come down
thump, and that would crack our skulls, and our brains would roll out on
the pavement. Ough! wouldn't they look nasty, just like a sheep's! And
mamma and Aunt Victoria would rush out, and Harriet and Mrs. Davy, and
they'd have to hold mamma up by the arms. Then they'd pick us up, and
carry us in, and lay us out on a bed, and say they were beautiful in
their lives, and in death they were not divided; and when they shut the
house up at night and it was all still, mamma would cry. She'd be always
crying, especially for you, Bernadine, because you're not such a trouble
as I am. And when you were buried, and the worms were eating you, she
would give all the world to have you here again."</p>

<p>This sad prospect was too much for the sensitive Bernadine. "Don't,
Beth," she whimpered. "You frighten me."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't be frightened," said Beth encouragingly. "When people
up on a height like this get frightened, they always roll off. Do you
feel as if the roof were moving?" she exclaimed, suddenly clutching
hold.</p>

<p>Bernadine fell down flat on her face with a dismal howl.</p>

<p>"Let's be cats now," said Beth. "I'll say miew-ow-ow, and you
oo-oo-owl-hiss-ss-ss."</p>

<p>"Don't, Beth. I want to go back."</p>

<p>"Come along then," said Beth.</p>

<p>"I can't. I daren't move."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said Beth; "just follow me. I shall go and leave you if
you don't. You shouldn't have come up if you were afraid."</p>

<p>"You made me," Bernadine whimpered with her eyes shut.</p>

<p>"Of course it was me!" said Beth, on her way back to the skylight. "You
haven't a will of your own, I suppose!"</p>

<p>"You aren't leaving me, Beth!" Bernadine cried in an agony. "Don't go!
I'm frightened! Help me down! I'll tell mamma!"</p>

<p>"Then there you'll sit, tell-pie-tit," Beth chanted, as she let herself
down through the skylight.</p>

<p>Presently she appeared on the other side of the street, and performed a
war-dance of delight as she looked up at her sister, prone upon the
roof-ridge.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
"You do look so funny, Bernadine," she cried. "Your petticoats are
nohow; and you seem to have only one leg, and it is so long and thin!"</p>

<p>Bernadine howled aloud. Mrs. Caldwell was not at home; but the cry
brought Mrs. Davy out in her spectacles. When she saw the child's
dangerous predicament, she seized Beth and shook her emphatically.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," said Beth.</p>

<p>"What 'a' you bin doin' now, you bad girl?" said Mrs. Davy. "Hold on,
missy," she called up to Bernadine. "We'll soon 'ave ye down. You're all
right! You'll not take no 'arm."</p>

<p>Harriet now came running out, wringing her hands, and uttering
hysterical exclamations.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you fool," said Mrs. Davy.</p>

<p>Doors opened all the way down the street, and a considerable crowd had
soon collected. Beth, quite detached from herself, leant against the
orchard-wall and watched the people with interest.</p>

<p>How to get the child down was the difficulty, as there was no ladder at
hand long enough to reach up to the roof.</p>

<p>"I'll go and fetch her down if you like," said Beth.</p>

<p>"I should think so! and then there'd be two of you," said Mrs. Davy.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you'll manage it then," said Beth. "There isn't
foothold for a man to get out of the attic-window." Having spoken, she
strolled off with an air of indifference, and disappeared. She was a
heroine of romance now, going to do a great deed; and before she was
missed, the horrified spectators saw her climbing out of the front
attic-window smiling serenely. The people held their breath as they
watched her go up the roof on the slippery tiles at a reckless rate to
her sister.</p>

<p>"Come along, Bernadine," she whispered. "Such fun! There's a whole crowd
down there watching us. Just let them see you're not afraid."</p>

<p>Bernadine peeped. It was gratifying to be an object of such interest.</p>

<p>"Come along, don't be an idiot," said Beth. "Just follow me, and don't
look at anything but the tiles. That's the way <i>I</i> learnt to do it."</p>

<p>Bernadine's courage revived. Slowly she slid from the roof-ridge, Beth
helping her carefully. It looked fearfully dangerous, and the people
below dared not utter a sound. When they got to the attic-window, Beth,
herself on the edge of the roof, guided her sister past her, and helped
her in. She was following herself, when some tiles gave way beneath her,
and fell with a crash into the street. Fortunately she had hold of the
sill, but for a moment her legs hung over; then she pulled herself
through, and, falling head first on to the floor, disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> from
sight. The people below relieved their feelings with a faint cheer.</p>

<p>"Eh, but she's a <i>bad</i> un," said Mrs. Davy, who was trembling all over.</p>

<p>"Well, she's a rare plucky un, at any rate," said a man in the crowd,
admiringly.</p>

<p>Crowds constantly collected at the little house in Orchard Street in
those days. When Mrs. Caldwell had to go out alone she was always
anxious, not knowing what might be happening in her absence. Coming home
from Lady Benyon's one summer evening, she found the whole street
blocked with people, and the roadway in front of her own house packed so
tight she could not get past. Beth had dressed herself up in a mask and
a Russian sheepskin cloak which had belonged to her father, and sat
motionless in the drawing-room window on a throne made of an arm-chair
set on a box; while Bernadine played Scotch airs on the piano. A couple
of children passing had stopped to see what on earth the thing was, then
a man and woman had come along and stopped too, then several girls, some
sailors, the bellman, and many more, until the street was full. Harriet
was enjoying the commotion in the background, but when Mrs. Caldwell
appeared, she gave the signal, the piano stopped, and the strange beast
roared loudly and fled.</p>

<p>But Beth had her human moments. They generally came on in wet weather,
which depressed her. She would then stand in the drawing-room window by
the hour together, looking out at the miserable street, thinking of the
poor people, all cold and wet and hungry. She longed to do something for
them, and one day she stopped a little girl who was going with a jug for
some beer to the "Shining Star," a quiet little public-house on the same
side of the street.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are a very ignorant little girl," said Beth severely.</p>

<p>"Aw?"</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Emily Bean."</p>

<p>"Do you learn lessons?"</p>

<p>"Naw."</p>

<p>"Dear me, how dreadful!" said Beth. "You ought to be taught, you know.
Would you like to be taught?"</p>

<p>"Ah should."</p>

<p>"Well, you come here every afternoon at two o'clock, and I'll teach
you."</p>

<p>"Ah mon jest ass mother first," said Emily.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I'd forgotten that," Beth rejoined. "Well, you come if she lets
you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Emily nodded, and was going on her errand, but stopped. "Did you ass yer
own mother if you might?" she wanted to know.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't think of that either," Beth rejoined. "But I will."</p>

<p>"Will she let you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know"&mdash;rather doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I expect she will if you wait until she's in a good humour," the child
of the people sagely suggested.</p>

<p>"All right. You come at any rate," Beth answered boldly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell consented. She came of a long line of lady patronesses,
and thought it natural and becoming that her child should wish to
improve the "common people." Punctually to the moment Emily arrived next
day, and Beth sat down with her in the kitchen, and taught her a, b, ab,
and b, a, d, bad. Then she repeated a piece of poetry to her, and read
her a little story. Harriet was busy in the back kitchen, and Bernadine
was out with her mother and Aunt Victoria, so Beth and her pupil had the
kitchen to themselves. The next day, however, Harriet wanted to clean
the kitchen, so they had to retire to the acting-room. This was Beth's
first attempt to apply such knowledge as she possessed, and in her
anxiety to improve the child of the people, she improved herself in
several respects. She began to read better, became less afraid of
writing and spelling, mastered the multiplication table, and found she
could "make out" how to do easy sums from the book. This gave her the
first real interest she had ever had in school-work, and inspired her
with some slight confidence in herself. She felt the dignity of the
position of teacher too, and the responsibility. She never betrayed her
own ignorance, nor did anything to shake Emily's touching belief in her
superiority; and she never shook Emily. She knew she could have done
better herself if there had been less thumping and shaking, and she had
the wisdom to profit by her mother's errors of judgment already&mdash;not
that Emily ever provoked her. The child was apt and docile, and the
lessons were a sort of improving game.</p>

<p>How to impart religious instruction was the thing that troubled Beth
most: she used to lie awake at night thinking out the problem. She found
that Emily had learnt many texts and hymns in the Sunday-school to which
she went regularly, and Beth made her repeat them, and soon knew them
all by heart herself; but she did not think that she taught Emily
enough. One day in church, however, she thought of a way to extend her
teaching. Bernadine had joined her class for fun, and was playing at
learning too; and now Beth proposed that they should fit up a chapel in
the acting-room, and resolve themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
 occasionally into a clergyman
and congregation. A chair with the bottom knocked out was the pulpit,
and a long narrow box stood on end was the reading-desk. Beth was the
parson, of course, in a white sheet filched from the soiled-clothes bag,
and changed for a black shawl for the sermon. She read portions of
Scripture standing, she read prayers on her knees, she led a hymn; and
then she got into the black shawl and preached. What these discourses
were about, she could not remember in after years; but they must have
been fascinating, for the congregation listened unwearied so long as she
chose to go on.</p>

<p>Emily was a disappointment in one way: she had no imagination. Beth
pretended to take her photograph one day, after the manner of the
photographers on the sands.</p>

<p>"Now, this is the picture," she said, showing her a piece of glass.</p>

<p>"But there isn't no picture on it," said Emily, staring hard at the
glass.</p>

<p>"How stupid you are," said Beth, disgusted. "Look again."</p>

<p>"There isn't," Emily protested. "Just you show it to Bernadine."</p>

<p>"You should say <i>Miss</i> Bernadine," that young lady admonished her.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards Emily corrected Bernadine for not saying miss
to Beth and herself. Beth tried to explain, but Emily could not see why
she should say miss to them if they did not say miss to her and to each
other.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Caldwell was in great straits for want of money at this time.
She had scarcely enough to pay for their meagre fare, and her own
clothes and the children's were almost beyond patching and darning. Beth
surprised her several times sitting beside the dining-table with the
everlasting mending on her lap, fretting silently, and the child's heart
was wrung. There was some legal difficulty, and letters which added to
her mother's trouble came to the house continually.</p>

<p>The same faculty made Beth either the naughtiest or the best of
children; the difference depended on her heart: if that were touched,
she was all sympathy; but if no appeal was made to her feelings, her
daily doings were the outcome of so many erratic impulses acted on
without consideration, merely to vary the disastrous monotony of those
long idle afternoons.</p>

<p>The day after she had surprised her mother fretting over her letters,
another packet arrived. Beth happened to be early up that morning, and
opened the door to the postman. She would like to have given the packet
back to him, but that being impossible, she carried it up to the
acting-room and hid it in the roof.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
When her mother came down, however,
she found to her consternation that the fact of there being no letter at
all that morning was a greater trouble if anything than the arrival of
the one the day before; so she boldly brought it down and delivered it,
quite expecting to be whipped. But for once Mrs. Caldwell asked for an
explanation, and the child's motive was so evident that even her mother
was more affected by her sympathy than enraged by the inconvenient
expression of it.</p>

<p>The next day she was playing on the pier with Bernadine. Her mother and
Aunt Victoria were walking up and down, not paying much attention to the
children. First they swung on a chain that was stretched from post to
post down the middle of the pier to keep people from being washed off in
stormy weather; but Bernadine tumbled over backwards and hurt her head,
and was jeered at besides by some rude little street children, who could
not understand why the little Caldwells, who were as shabby as
themselves, should look down on them, and refuse to associate with them.
It was not Beth's nature to be exclusive. She had no notion of
differences of degree. Any pleasant person was her equal. She was as
much gratified by friendly notice from the milkman, the fishwoman, and
the sweep as from Lady Benyon or Count Bartahlinsky; and very early
thought it contemptible to jeer at people for want of means and defects
of education. She never talked of the "common people," after she found
that Harriet was hurt by the phrase; and she would have been on good
terms with all the street children had it not been for what Mrs.
Caldwell called "Bernadine's superior self-respect." Bernadine told if
Beth spoke to one of them, and as Beth had no friends amongst them as
yet, she did not feel that their acquaintance was worth fighting for.
But the street children resented the attitude of the two shabby little
ladies, and were always watching for opportunities to annoy them.
Accordingly, when Bernadine tumbled off the chain head-over-heels
backwards, there was a howl of derision. "Oh my! Ain't she getten thin
legs!" "Ah say, Julia, did you see that big 'ole i' her stockin'?" "Naw,
but ah seed the patch on 'er petticoat!" "Eh&mdash;an' she's on'y getten one
on, an' it isn't flannel." "An' them's ladies!"</p>

<p>Bernadine's pride came to her rescue on these occasions. At home she
howled when she was hurt, but now she affected to laugh, and both
sisters strolled off with their little heads up, and an exasperating air
of indifference to the enemy. The tide was out, and they went down into
the harbour and found a large oyster among the piles of the wooden
jetty. When they got home, the difficulty was how to open it; but they
managed to make it open itself by holding it over the kitchen fire on
the shovel. When it began to lift its lid, Beth sent Bernadine for a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fork, and while she was getting it Beth ate the oyster. But Bernadine
could not see the joke, and her rage was not to be appeased even by the
oyster-shell, which Beth said she might have the whole of.</p>

<p>The battle came off after dinner that evening But it was a day of
disaster. Harriet was out of temper; and Mrs. Caldwell appeared
mysteriously, just as Beth knocked Bernadine down and sat on her
stomach.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>They were reading a story of French life at that time, and something
came into it about snail-broth as a cure for consumption, and snail-oil
as a remedy for rheumatism. The next day there was a most extraordinary
smell all over the house. Mrs. Caldwell, Aunt Victoria, Harriet, and
Bernadine went sniffing about, but could find nothing to account for it.
Beth sat at the dining-table with a book before her, taking no notice.
At last Harriet had occasion to open the oven door, and just as she did
so there was a loud explosion, and the kitchen wall opposite was
bespattered with boiling animal matter. Beth had got up early, and
collected snails enough in the garden to fill a blacking-bottle, corked
them up tight, and put them into the darkest corner of the oven, her
idea being to render them into oil, as Harriet rendered suet into fat,
and go and rub rheumatic people with it. As usual, however, her motive
was ignored, while a great deal was made of the mess on the kitchen
wall&mdash;which disheartened her, especially as several other philanthropic
enterprises happened to fail about the same time.</p>

<p>Emily appeared with a bad toothache one day, and finding a remedy for it
gave Beth a momentary interest in life. She told Emily she had a cure
for toothache, and Emily, never doubting, let her put some soft
substance into the tooth with the end of a match.</p>

<p>"It won't taste very nice," said Beth; "but you mustn't mind that. You
just go home, and you'll find it won't ache any more."</p>

<p>When Emily returned next day she gratefully proclaimed herself cured,
and her mother wanted to know "whatever the stuff was."</p>

<p>"Soap," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mucky thing!" Emily exclaimed. She resented the application of
such a substance to the inside of her person. Her plebeian mind was too
narrow to conceive a second legitimate use for soap, and from that day
Beth's influence declined. Emily's attendance became irregular, then
gradually ceased altogether; not, however, before Beth's own interest in
the lessons was over, and her mind much occupied with other things.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span>
 dower-house of the Benyon family stood in a street which was merely
an extension of Orchard Street, and could be seen from Mrs. Caldwell's
windows. Lady Benyon, having produced a huge family, and buried her
husband, had done her day's work in the world, as it were, and now had
full leisure to live as she liked; so she "lived well"; and in the
intervals of living, otherwise eating, she sat in the big bow-window of
her sitting-room, digesting, and watching her neighbours. From her large
old-fashioned house she commanded a fine view down the wide irregular
front street to the sea, with a diagonal glimpse down two other streets
which ran parallel with the front street; while on the left she could
see up Orchard Street as far as the church; so that everybody came under
her observation sooner or later, and, to Beth, it always seemed that she
dominated the whole place. Most of the day her head could be seen above
the wire-blind; but, as she seldom went out, her acute old face and the
four dark sausage-shaped curls, laid horizontally on either side of it,
were almost all of her that was known to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell went regularly to see Lady Benyon, and sometimes took the
children with her. On one occasion when she had done so, Lady Benyon
made her take a seat in the window where she was sitting herself, so
that they could both look out. Beth and Bernadine sat in the background
with a picture-book, in which they seemed so absorbed that the
conversation flowed on before them with very little constraint. Beth's
ears were open, however, as usual.</p>

<p>"After twenty-two children," Lady Benyon remarked, "one cannot expect to
be as active as one was."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," Mrs. Caldwell answered cheerfully. "<i>I</i> have only had as
good as fourteen, and I'm quite a wreck. I don't know what it is to pass
a day free from pain. But, however, it is so ordered, and I don't
complain. If only they turn out well when they do come, that's
everything."</p>

<p>"Ah, you're right there," Lady Benyon answered.</p>

<p>"You know <i>my</i> trial," Mrs. Caldwell pursued&mdash;Beth's face instantly
became a blank. "I am afraid she cares for no one but herself. It shows
what spoiling a child does. Her father could never make enough of her."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose she's naughty," Lady Benyon rejoined with a laugh; "but
she's promising all the same&mdash;and not only in appearance. The things she
says, you know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, yes," Mrs. Caldwell allowed. "She certainly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> says things
sometimes, but that's not much comfort when you never know what she'll
be doing. Now Mildred has never given me a moment's anxiety in her life,
except on account of her delicate health, poor little body; and
Bernadine is a dear, sweet little thing. <i>She</i> is the only one who is
thoroughly unruly and selfish."</p>

<p>Beth's blood boiled at the accusation.</p>

<p>"How does the old aunt get on?" Lady Benyon asked presently.</p>

<p>"Oh, she seems to be very well."</p>

<p>"Don't you find it rather a trial to have her about always?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell shrugged her shoulders with an air of resignation. "Oh,
you know, she means well," she replied, "and there really was nothing
else for it. But I must say I have no patience with cant."</p>

<p>Beth, in opposition, still smarting from her mother's accusation of
selfishness, determined at once to inquire into Aunt Victoria's
religious tenets, with a view to approving of them.</p>

<p>"Well, James Patten played a mean part in that business," Lady Benyon
observed. "But I always say, beware of a man who does his own
housekeeping. When they keep the money in their own hands, and pay the
bills themselves, don't trust them. That sort of man is a cur at heart,
you may be sure. And as for a man who takes possession of his wife's
money, and doles it out to her a little at a time&mdash;! I know one
such&mdash;without a penny of his own, mind you! He gives his wife a cheque
for five pounds a month; the rest goes on other women, and she never
suspects it! He's one of those plausible gentlemen who's always looking
for a post that will pay him, and never gets it&mdash;you know the kind of
thing." Here the old lady caught Beth's eye. "You take my advice," she
said. "Don't ever marry a man who does his own housekeeping. He's a
crowing hen, that sort of man, you may be sure. I warn you against the
man who does a woman's work."</p>

<p>"And if a woman does a man's work?" said the intelligent Beth.</p>

<p>"It is often a very great help," Mrs. Caldwell put in, with a quick
mental survey of the reams of official letters she had written for her
husband.</p>

<p>Lady Benyon pursed up her mouth.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Aunt Victoria was one of those forlorn old ladies who have nobody
actually their own to care for them, although they may have numbers of
relations, and acquire odd habits from living much alone. She was a
great source of interest to Beth, who would sit silently watching her by
the hour together, her bright

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
 eyes steady and her countenance a blank.
The intentness of her gaze fidgeted the old lady, who would look up
suddenly every now and then and ask her what she was staring at.
"Nothing, Aunt Victoria; I was only thinking," Beth always answered; and
then she affected to occupy herself until the old lady returned to her
work or her book, when Beth would resume her interrupted study. But she
liked Aunt Victoria. The old lady was sharp with her sometimes, but she
meant to be kind, and was always just; and Beth respected her. She had
more faith in her, too, than she had in her mother, and secretly became
her partisan on all occasions. She had instantly detected the tone of
detraction in the allusions Lady Benyon and her mother had made to Aunt
Victoria that afternoon, and stolidly resented it.</p>

<p>When they went home, she ran upstairs and knocked at Aunt Victoria's
door. It was immediately opened, and Beth, seeing what she took for an
old gentleman in a short black petticoat and loose red jacket, with
short, thick, stubbly white hair standing up all over his head, started
back. But it was only Aunt Victoria without her cap and front. When she
saw Beth's consternation, the old lady put her hand up to her head. "I
had forgotten," she muttered; then she added severely, "But you should
never show surprise, Beth, at anything in anybody's appearance. It is
very ill-bred."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall ever be surprised again," Beth answered quaintly.
"But I want you to tell me, Aunt Victoria. What do you believe in?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know, about God, and the Bible, and cant, and that sort of
thing," Beth answered evenly.</p>

<p>"Come in and sit down," said Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>Beth sat on a classical piece of furniture that stood in the window, a
sort of stool or throne, with ends like a sofa and no back. It had
belonged to Aunt Victoria's father, and she valued it very much. Beth's
feet, as she sat on it, did not touch the ground. Aunt Victoria stood
for a moment in the middle of the room reflecting, and, as she did so,
she looked, with her short, thick, stubbly white hair, more like a thin
old gentleman in a black petticoat and loose red jacket than ever.</p>

<p>"I believe, Beth," she said solemnly, "I believe in God the Father
Almighty. I believe that if we do His holy will here on earth, we shall,
when we die, be received by Him into bliss everlasting; but if we do not
do His holy will, then He will condemn us to the bad place, where we
shall burn for ever."</p>

<p>"But what <i>is</i> His holy will?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"It is His holy will that we should do right, and that we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> should not do
wrong. But this is a big subject, Beth, and I can only unfold it to you
bit by bit."</p>

<p>"But will you unfold it?"</p>

<p>"I will, as best I can, if you will listen earnestly."</p>

<p>"I am always in earnest," Beth answered sincerely.</p>

<p>"No one can teach you God," Aunt Victoria pursued. "He must come to you.
'<i>Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright of
heart. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth
His handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night
showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language where their voice is
not heard. Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye
everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King
of glory? The Lord strong and mighty.</i>'"</p>

<p>Beth, in a burst of enthusiasm, jumped down from her perch, clasped her
hands to her chest, and cried&mdash;"O Aunt Victoria! that is&mdash;that is"&mdash;she
tore at her hair&mdash;"I want a word&mdash;I want a word!"</p>

<p>"It is <i>grand</i>, Beth!"</p>

<p>"Grand! grand!" Beth shouted. "Yes, it is grand."</p>

<p>"Beth," said Aunt Victoria emphatically, "remember that you are a
Christian child, and not a dancing-dervish. If you do not instantly calm
yourself, I shall shake you. And if I ever see you give way to such wild
excitement again, I <i>shall</i> shake you, for your own good. Calm is one of
the first attributes of a gentlewoman."</p>

<p>Teachers of religion do not always practise what they preach. Up to this
moment, although Beth had done her best to teach Emily, she had had no
idea of being religious herself; but now, on a sudden, there came upon
her that great yearning tenderness towards God, and desire for goodness,
which some sects call conversion, and hold to be the essential beginning
of a religious life. This was the opportunity Aunt Victoria had prayed
for, and from that time forward she began to instruct Beth
systematically in religious matters. The subject fascinated Beth, and
she would make opportunities to be alone with her aunt, and go to her
room willingly whenever she asked her, for the pleasure of hearing her.
Aunt Victoria often moved about the room, and dressed as she talked, and
Beth, while listening, did not fail to observe the difficulty of keeping
stockings up on skinny legs when you wore woollen garters below the
knee; and also that it looked funny to have to tuck up your dress to get
your purse out of a pocket in your petticoat at the back. But when Aunt
Victoria sat down and read the Bible aloud, Beth became absorbed, and
would even read whole chapters again to herself in order to remember how
to declaim the more poetical passages as Aunt Victoria

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> did&mdash;all of
which she relished with the keenest enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Beth,
however, Aunt Victoria was strongly Calvinistic, and dwelt too much on
death and the judgment for her mental health. The old lady, deeply as
she sympathised with Beth, and loved her, did not realise how morbidly
sensitive she was; and accordingly worked on her feelings until the fear
of God got hold of her. Just at this time, too, Mrs. Caldwell chose "The
Pilgrim's Progress" for a "Sunday book," and read it aloud to the
children; and this, together with Aunt Victoria's views, operated only
too actively on the child's vivid imagination. A great dread seized upon
her&mdash;not on her own account, strange to say; she never thought of
herself, but of her friends, and of the world at large. She was in
mortal dread lest they should be called to judgment and consigned to the
flames. While the sun was out such thoughts did not trouble her; but as
the day declined, and twilight sombrely succeeded the sunset, her heart
sank, and her little being was racked with one great petition, offered
up to the Lord in anguish, that He would spare them all.</p>

<p>The season was beginning, the little place was already full of visitors,
and Beth used to stand at the dining-room window while Mrs. Caldwell was
reading aloud on Sunday evenings, and watch the congregation stream out
of the church at the end of the road, and suffer agonies because of the
torments that awaited them all, including her mother, brothers and
sisters, Harriet in the kitchen, and Mrs. Davy at Orchard House
opposite&mdash;everybody, indeed, except Aunt Victoria&mdash;in a future state.
Out on the cliffs in the summer evenings, when great dark masses of
cloud tinged with crimson were piled to the zenith at sundown, and
coldly reflected in the dark waters of the bay, she saw the destination
of the world; she heard cries of torment, too, in the plash of breaking
waves and the unceasing roar of the sea; and as she watched the visitors
lounging about in bright dresses, laughing and talking, careless of
their doom, she could hardly restrain her tears. Night after night when
she went to bed, she put her head under the clothes that Bernadine might
not hear, and her chest was torn with sobs until she fell asleep.</p>

<p>At that time she devised no more tricks, she took no interest in games,
and would not fight even. Bernadine did not know what to make of her.
All day she was recovering from the lassitude caused by the mental
anguish of the previous evening, but regularly at sunset it began again;
and the more she suffered, the less able was she to speak on the
subject. At first she had tried to discuss eternal punishment with
Harriet, Bernadine, and Aunt Victoria, and each had responded
characteristically. Harriet's imagination dwelt on the particular
torments reserved for certain people she knew, which she described
graphically. Bernadine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
 listened to Beth's remarks with interest, then
accused Beth of trying to frighten her, and said she would tell mamma.
Aunt Victoria discoursed earnestly on the wages of sin, the sufferings
of sinners, the glories of salvation, the peace on earth from knowing
you are saved, and the pleasures of the world to come; but the more Beth
heard of the joys of heaven, the more she dreaded the horrors of hell.
Still, however, she was too shy to say anything about her own acute
mental misery, and no one suspected that anything was wrong, until one
day something dejected in the child's attitude happened to catch Aunt
Victoria's attention.</p>

<p>Beth was sitting on an African stool, her elbow on her knee, her chin
resting on her little hand, her grey eyes looking up through the window
at the summer sky. What could the child be thinking of, Aunt Victoria
wondered, and surely she was looking thin and pale&mdash;quite haggard.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get something to do, Beth?" the old lady asked. "It's bad
for little girls to idle about all day."</p>

<p>"I wish I had something to do," Beth answered. "I'm so tired."</p>

<p>"Does your head ache, child?" Aunt Victoria asked, speaking sharply
because her mind was disturbed.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You should answer politely, and say 'No, thank you.'"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Aunt Victoria," was the docile rejoinder.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria resolved to speak to Mrs. Caldwell, and resumed her
knitting. She was one of those people who can keep what they have to say
till a suitable occasion offers. Her mind was never so full of any one
subject as to overflow and make a mess of it. She would wait a week
watching her opportunity if necessary; and she did not, therefore,
although she saw Mrs. Caldwell frequently during the day, speak to her
about Beth until the children had gone to bed in the evening, when she
was sure of her effect.</p>

<p>Then she began abruptly.</p>

<p>"Caroline, that child Beth is ill."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell was startled. It was very inconsiderate of Aunt Victoria.
She knew she was nervous about her children; how could she be so
unfeeling? What made her think Beth ill?</p>

<p>"Look at her!" said Aunt Victoria. "She eats nothing. She has wasted to
a skeleton, she has no blood in her face at all, and her eyes look as if
she never slept."</p>

<p>"I am sure she sleeps well enough," Mrs. Caldwell answered, inclined to
bridle.</p>

<p>"I feel quite sure, Caroline," Aunt Victoria said solemnly, "that if you
take a candle, and go upstairs this minute, you will find that child
wide awake."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell felt that she was being found fault with, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> was
indignant. She went upstairs at once, with her head held high, expecting
to find Beth in a healthy sleep. The relief, however, of finding that
the child was well, would not have been so great at the moment as the
satisfaction of proving Aunt Victoria in the wrong.</p>

<p>But Beth was wide awake, petitioning God in an agony to spare her
friends. When Mrs. Caldwell entered she started up.</p>

<p>"O mamma!" she exclaimed, "I'm so glad you've come; I've been so
frightened about you."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Beth?" Mrs. Caldwell asked, not
over-gently. "What are you frightened about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Beth faltered, shrinking back into herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nonsense," her mother answered. "It's silly to be frightened
at nothing, and cowardly to be frightened at all. Lie down and go to
sleep, like a good child. Come, turn your face to the wall, and I'll
tuck you in."</p>

<p>Beth obeyed, and her mother left her to her fears, and returned to Aunt
Victoria in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Well?" Aunt Victoria asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"She was awake," Mrs. Caldwell acknowledged. "She said she was
frightened, but didn't know what of. I expect she'd been dreaming. And
I'm sure there is nothing the matter with her. She's been subject to
queer fits of alarm at night ever since she was a baby. It's the dark, I
think. It makes her nervous. At one time the doctor made us have a
night-light for her, which was great nonsense, <i>I</i> always said; but her
father insisted. When it suits her to play in the dark, she's never
afraid."</p>

<p>It was at this time that Rainharbour set up a band of its own. Beth was
always peculiarly susceptible to music. Her ear was defective; she
rarely knew if any one sang flat; but the poorest instrument would lay
hold of her, and set high chords of emotion vibrating, beyond the reach
of words. The first time she heard the band, she was completely carried
away. It was on the pier, and she happened to be close beside it when it
began to play, and stood still in astonishment at the crash of the
opening bars. Her mother, after vainly calling to her to come on,
snatched impatiently at her arm to drag her away; and Beth, in her
excitement, set her teeth and slapped at her mother's hand&mdash;or rather at
what seemed to her the importunate thing that was trying to end her
ecstasy.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Caldwell would not stand that, so Beth, victim of brute
force, was hustled off to the end of the pier, and then slapped, shaken,
and reviled, for the enormity of her offence, until, in an acute nervous
crisis, she wrenched herself out of her mother's clutches, and sprang
over into the harbour. It was high-water happily, and Count Gustav
Bartahlinsky, who was just

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
 going out in his yacht, saw her drop, and
fished her out with a boat-hook.</p>

<p>"Look here, young woman," he said, "what do you mean by tumbling about
like this? I shall have the trouble of turning back and putting you on
shore."</p>

<p>"No, don't; no, don't," Beth pleaded. "Take me along with you."</p>

<p>He looked at her an instant, considering, then went to the side of the
yacht, and called up to her frantic mother: "She's all right. I'll have
her dried, and bring her back this afternoon,"&mdash;with which assurance
Mrs. Caldwell was obliged to content herself, for the yacht sailed on;
not that she would have objected. Beth and Count Gustav were sworn
allies by this time, and Mrs. Caldwell knew that Beth could not be in
better hands. Beth had seen Count Gustav passing their window a few days
after their first meeting, and had completed her conquest of him by
tearing out, and running down Orchard Street after him with nothing on
her head, to ask what copyright was; and since then they had often met,
and sometimes spent delightful hours together, sitting on the cliffs or
strolling along by the sea. He had discovered her talent for
verse-making, and given her a book on the subject, full of examples,
which was a great joy to her. When the yacht was clear of the harbour,
he took her down to the saloon, and got out a silk shirt. "I'm going to
leave you," he said, "and when I'm gone, you must take off all your
things, and put this shirt on. Then tumble into that berth between the
blankets, and I'll come back and talk to you." Beth promptly obeyed. She
was an ill-used heroine now, in the hands of her knightly deliverer, and
thoroughly happy.</p>

<p>When Count Gustav returned, he was followed by Gard, a tall, dark,
handsome sailor, a descendant of black Dane settlers on the coast, and
for that reason commonly called Black Gard. He brought sandwiches,
cakes, and hot tea on a tray for Beth. She had propped herself up with
pillows in the berth, and was looking out of an open port-hole opposite,
listening enraptured to the strains of the band, which, mellowed by
distance, floated out over the water.</p>

<p>"What a radiant little face!" the Count thought, as he handed her the
tea and sandwiches.</p>

<p>Beth took them voraciously.</p>

<p>"Did you have any breakfast?" the Count asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"What did you have?"</p>

<p>"Milk and hot water and dry toast. I made the toast myself."</p>

<p>"No butter?"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. The butter's running short, so I wouldn't take any."</p>

<p>"When do you lunch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't lunch. Can't afford it, you know. The boys have got to be
educated, and Uncle James Patten won't help, though Jim's his heir."</p>

<p>Count Gustav looked at her little delicate hand lying on the coverlet,
and then at the worn little face.</p>

<p>"You've been crying," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah, that was only last night after I went to bed," Beth answered. "It
makes you cry when people aren't saved, doesn't it? Are you saved? If
you're not it will be awful for me."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"'Cos it would hurt so here to think of you burning in hell"&mdash;Beth
clasped her chest. "It always begins to ache here&mdash;in the evening&mdash;for
the people who aren't saved, and when I go to bed it makes me cry."</p>

<p>"Who told you about being saved, and that?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria. She lives with us, you know. She's going away now to pay
a visit, because the boys are coming home, and Mildred, for the
holidays, and there wouldn't be room for her. I'm dreadfully sorry; but
I shall go to church, and read the Bible just the same when she's away."</p>

<p>Count Gustav sat down on the end of the saloon-table and reflected a
little; then he said&mdash;"I wouldn't read anything, if I were you, while
Aunt Victoria's away. Just play about with Mildred and the boys, and
come out fishing with me sometimes. God doesn't want <i>you</i> to save
people. He does that Himself. I expect He's very angry because you cry
at night. He thinks you don't trust Him. All He wants you to do is to
love Him, and trust Him, and be happy. That's the creed for a little
girl."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" Beth gasped. Then she began to reflect, and her big
grey eyes slowly dilated, while at the same time a look of intense
relief relaxed the muscles of her pinched little face. "Do you think
so?" she repeated. Then suddenly she burst into tears.</p>

<p>Count Gustav, somewhat disconcerted, hurriedly handed her a
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Another gentleman came into the saloon at the moment, and raised
inquiring eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Only a little martyr, momentarily released from suffering, enjoying the
reaction," Count Gustav observed. "Come on deck, and let her sleep. Do
you hear, little lady, go to sleep."</p>

<p>Beth, docile to a fault when gently handled, nestled down among the
blankets, shut her eyes, and prepared to obey. The sound of the water
rippling off the sides of the yacht as it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
 glided on smoothly over the
summer-sea both soothed and cheered her. Heavenly thoughts came crowding
into her mind; then sleep surprised her, with the tears she had been
shedding for the sufferings of others still wet upon her cheek. When she
awoke, her clothes were beside her, ready to put on. She jumped up
instantly, dressed, and went on deck. The yacht was almost stationary,
and the two gentlemen, attended by the black Dane, Gard, were fishing.
Away to starboard, the land lay like a silver mist in the heat of the
afternoon. Beth turned her sorrowful little face towards it.</p>

<p>"Are you homesick, Beth?" Count Gustav asked.</p>

<p>"No, sick of home," Beth answered; "but I suppose I shall have to go
back."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"Mamma will punish me for jumping into the harbour, I expect."</p>

<p>"<i>Jumping</i> in!" he ejaculated, and then a great gravity settled upon
him, and he cogitated for some time. "Why did you jump in?" he said at
last.</p>

<p>"Because mamma&mdash;because mamma&mdash;" her chest heaved. She was ashamed to
say.</p>

<p>Count Gustav exchanged glances with the other gentleman, and said no
more. But he took her home himself in the evening, and had a long talk
with mamma and Aunt Victoria; and after he had gone they were both
particularly nice to Beth, but very solemn. That night, too, Aunt
Victoria did not mention death and the judgment, but talked of heaven
and the mercy of God until Beth's brow cleared, and she was filled with
hope.</p>

<p>It was the next day that Aunt Victoria left them to make room for
Mildred and the boys. Beth went with her mother to see the old lady off
at the station. On account of their connections the little party
attracted attention, and Mrs. Caldwell, feeling her importance, expected
the officials to be obsequious, which they were; and, in return, she
also expected Aunt Victoria to make proper acknowledgment of their
attentions. She considered that sixpence at least was necessary to
uphold the dignity of the family on such occasions; but, to her horror,
when the moment came, Aunt Victoria, after an exciting fumble, drew from
her reticule a tract entitled "The Man on the Slant," and, in the face
of everybody, handed it to the expectant porter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell assured Lady Benyon afterwards that she should never
forget that moment. Beth used to wonder why.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> end of the holidays found Beth in a very different mood. Jim had
come with the ideas of his adolescence, and Mildred had brought new
music, and these together had helped to take her completely out of
herself. The rest from lessons, too&mdash;from her mother's method of making
education a martyrdom, and many more hours of each day than usual spent
in the open air, had also helped greatly to ease her mind and strengthen
her body, so that, even in the time, which was only a few weeks, she had
recovered her colour, shot up, and expanded.</p>

<p>Most of the time she had spent with Jim, whom she had studied with
absorbing interest, his point of view was so wholly unexpected. And even
in these early days she showed a trait of character for which she
afterwards became remarkable; that is to say, she learned the whole of
the facts of a case before she formed an opinion on its merits&mdash;listened
and observed uncritically, without prejudice and without personal
feeling, until she was fully informed. Life unfolded itself to her like
the rules of arithmetic. She could not conjecture what the answer would
be in any single example from a figure or two, but had to take them all
down in order to work the sum. And her object was always, not to prove
herself right in any guess she might have made, but to arrive at the
truth. She was eleven years old at this time, but looked fourteen.</p>

<p>It was when she went out shooting with Jim that they used to have their
most interesting discussions. Jim used to take her to carry things, but
never offered her a shot, because she was a girl. She did not care about
that, however, because she had made up her mind to take the gun when he
was gone, and go out shooting on her own account; and she abstracted a
certain amount of powder and shot from his flasks each day to pay
herself for her present trouble, and also to be ready for the future.
Uncle James had given Jim leave to shoot, provided he sent the game he
killed to Fairholm; and sometimes they spent the day wandering through
the woods after birds, and sometimes they sat on the cliffs, which
skirted the property, potting rabbits. Jim expected Beth to act as a
keeper for him, and also to retrieve like a well-trained dog; and when
on one occasion she disappointed him, he had a good deal to say about
the uselessness of sisters and the inferiority of the sex generally.
Women, he always maintained, were only fit to sew on buttons and mend
socks.</p>

<p>"But is it contemptible to sew on buttons and mend socks?"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> Beth asked,
one day when they were sitting in a sandy hollow waiting for rabbits.</p>

<p>"It's not a man's work," said Jim, a trifle disconcerted.</p>

<p>Beth looked about her. The great sea, the vast tract of sand, and the
blue sky so high above them, made her suffer for her own insignificance,
and feel for the moment that nothing was worth while; but in the hollow
where they sat it was cosy and the grass was green. Miniature cliffs
overhung the rabbit-holes, and the dry soil was silvered by sun and wind
and rain. There was a stiff breeze blowing, but it did not touch them in
their sheltered nook. They could hear it making its moan, however, as if
it were vainly trying to get at them; and there also ascended from below
the ceaseless sound of the sea. Beth turned her back on the wild
prospect, and watched the rabbit-holes.</p>

<p>"There's one on the right," she said at last, softly.</p>

<p>Jim raised his gun, aimed, and fired. The rabbit rolled over on its
back, and Beth rose in a leisurely way, fetched it, carrying it by its
legs, and threw it down on the bag.</p>

<p>"And when all the buttons are sewed on and all the socks mended, what is
a girl to do with her time?" she asked dispassionately, when she had
reseated herself. "The things only come home from the wash once a week,
you see."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's lots to be done," Jim answered vaguely. "There's the
cooking. A man's life isn't worth having if the cooking's bad."</p>

<p>"But a gentleman keeps a cook," Beth observed.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course," Jim answered irritably. "You would see what I mean
if you weren't a girl. Girls have no brains. They scream at a mouse."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> never scream at mice," Beth protested in surprise. "Bernadine
catches them in her hands."</p>

<p>"Ah, but then you've had brothers, you see," said Jim. "It makes all the
difference if you're taught not to be silly."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't all girls taught, and why aren't we taught more
things?"</p>

<p>"Because you've got no brains, I tell you."</p>

<p>"But if we can be taught one thing, why can't we be taught another? How
can you tell we've no brains if you never try to teach us?"</p>

<p>"Now look here, Miss Beth," said brother Jim in a tone of exasperation,
"I know what you'll be when you grow up, if you don't mind. You'll be
just the sort of long-tongued shrew, always arguing, that men hate."</p>

<p>"Do you say 'that men hate' or 'whom men hate'?" Beth interrupted.</p>

<p>"There you are!" said Jim; "devilish sharp at a nag. That's

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> just what
I'm telling you. Now, you take my advice, and hold your tongue. Then
perhaps you'll get a husband; and if you do, make things comfortable for
him. Men can't abide women who don't make things comfortable."</p>

<p>"Well," said Beth temperately, "I don't think I could 'abide' a man who
didn't make things comfortable."</p>

<p>Jim grunted, as though that point of view were a different thing
altogether.</p>

<p>By degrees Beth discovered that sisters did not hold at all the same
sort of place in Jim's estimation as "the girls." The girls were other
people's sisters, to whom Jim was polite, and whom he even fawned on and
flattered while they were present, but made most disparaging remarks
about and ridiculed behind their backs; to his own sisters, on the
contrary, he was habitually rude, but he always spoke of them nicely in
their absence, and even boasted about their accomplishments.</p>

<p>"Your brother Jim says you can act anything," Charlotte Hardy, the
doctor's daughter, told Beth. "And you recite wonderfully, although
you've never heard any one recite; and you talk like a grown-up person."</p>

<p>Beth flushed with surprise and pleasure at this; but her heart had
hardly time to expand before she observed the puzzling discrepancy
between what Jim said to her and what he had been saying to other
people, and found it impossible to reconcile the two, so as to have any
confidence in Jim's sincerity.</p>

<p>Before the end of the holidays she had learned to enjoy Jim's
companionship, but she had no respect for his opinions at all. He had
taught her a good deal, however. He had taught her, for one thing, the
futility of discussion with people of his capacity. The small intellect
should be treated like the small child&mdash;with tenderest consideration. It
must not hear too much of anything at a time, and there are certain
things that it must never be told at all. Simple familiar facts, with
obvious little morals, are the right food for it, and constant
repetition of what it knows is safe; but such heavy things as theories,
opinions, and arguments must be kept carefully concealed from it, for
fear of causing congestion or paralysis, or, worse still, that parlous
condition which betrays itself in distressing symptoms such as one sees
daily in society, or sits and shudders at in one's own friends, when the
victim, swelling with importance, makes confident mis-statements, draws
erroneous conclusions, sums up and gives advice so fatuous that you
blush to be a biped of the same species.</p>

<p>There was an hotel in Rainharbour called the "United Kingdom," where Jim
spent much of his time playing billiards, drinking beer, and smoking
pipes. He had to coax money out of his mother continually for these
pursuits.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's the kind of thing a fellow must do, you know, mamma," he said.
"You can't expect him to stick at home like a girl. He must see life, or
he'll be a muff instead of a man of the world. How shall I get on at
Fairholm, when I come in for the property, if I'm not up to things?"</p>

<p>This was said at breakfast one morning, and Mrs. Caldwell, sitting
opposite the window, raised her worn face and looked up at the sky,
considering what else there was that she could do without.</p>

<p>"Do you learn how to manage estates at the 'United Kingdom'?" Beth put
in innocently.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Beth, just you shut up," said Jim. "You're always
putting your oar in, and its deuced impertinent of a child like you,
when I'm talking to my mother. <i>She</i> knows what I'm talking about, and
you don't; but you'll be teaching her next, I expect. You're far too
cheeky."</p>

<p>"I only wanted to know," Beth protested.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Mrs. Caldwell impatiently. She was put out by Jim's
demand for money, which she had not got to spare, and found it a relief
to expend some of her irritation on Beth. "Jim is quite right, and I
won't have you hanging about always, listening to things you don't
understand, and rudely interrupting."</p>

<p>"I thought we were at breakfast," Beth exclaimed, furious at being
unjustly accused of hanging about.</p>

<p>"Be good enough to leave the table," said Mrs. Caldwell; "and you shall
have nothing but bread and water for the rest of the day."</p>

<p>"It will be a dinner of herbs with contentment, then, if I have it
alone," said Beth; for which impertinence she was condemned to be
present at every meal.</p>

<p>Having extracted the money from his mother, Jim went off to the "United
Kingdom," and came back in the afternoon, somewhat the worse for beer;
but Mrs. Caldwell did not perceive it. He complained of the poor dinner,
the cooking, and Beth's shabby appearance.</p>

<p>"How can you go out with me like that?" he said. "Why can't you dress
properly? Look at my things! I'm decent."</p>

<p>"So should I be," said Beth, without malice, her eyes shining with
mortification. "So should I be if anybody bought me decent clothes."</p>

<p>She did not think it unfair, however, that she should go shabby so that
Jim might be well dressed. Nor did she feel it wrong, when the holidays
were over, and the boys had gone, that she should be left idly drumming
on the window-pane; that they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
should have every advantage while she had
none, and no prospect but the uncertain chance of securing a husband if
she held herself well and did as she was told&mdash;a husband whom she would
be expected to obey whatever he might lack in the way of capacity to
order. It is suffering which makes these things plain to a generous
woman; but usually by the time she has suffered enough to be able to
blame those whom it has been her habit to love and respect, and to judge
of the wrong they have done her, it is too late to remedy it. Even if
her faculties have not atrophied for want of use, all that should have
been cultivated lies latent in her; she has nothing to fall back upon,
and her life is spoilt.</p>

<p>Beth stood idly drumming on the window-pane for long hours after the
boys had gone. Then she got her battered old hat, walked out to
Fairholm, and wandered over the ground where she had been wont to
retrieve for Jim. When she came to the warren, the rabbits were out
feeding, and she amused herself by throwing stones at them with her left
hand. She had the use of both hands, and would not have noticed if her
knife had been put where her fork should have been at table; but she
threw stones, bowled, batted, played croquet, and also tennis in after
years, with her left hand by preference, and she always held out her
left hand to be handed from a carriage.</p>

<p>She succeeded in killing a rabbit with a stone, to her own surprise and
delight, and carried it off home, where it formed a welcome addition to
the meagre fare. She skinned and cleaned it herself, boiled it, carved
it carefully so that it might not look like a cat on the dish, covered
it with good onion-sauce, and garnished it with little rolls of fried
bacon, and sent it to table, where the only other dish was cold
beef-bones with very little meat on them.</p>

<p>"Where did it come from?" Mrs. Caldwell asked, looking pleased.</p>

<p>"From Fairholm," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"I must thank your uncle," said Mrs. Caldwell.</p>

<p>"It was not my uncle," Beth answered, laughing; "and you're not to send
any thanks."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Mrs. Caldwell, still more pleased, for she
supposed it was a surreptitious kindness of Aunt Grace Mary's. She ate
the rabbit with appetite, and Beth, as she watched her, determined to go
hunting again, and see what she could get for her. Beth would not have
touched a penny of Uncle James's, but from that time forward she did not
scruple to poach on his estate, and bring home anything she could catch.
She had often prayed to the Lord to show her how to do something to help
her mother in her dire poverty, and when this idea occurred to her, she
accepted it as a direct answer to her prayer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell and the three girls slept in the largest bedroom

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> in the
house. It was at the back, looking into the little garden, and out to
the east. The early morning sun, making black bars of the window-frame
on the white blind, often awoke Beth, and she would lie and count the
white spaces between the bars, where the window-panes were,&mdash;three, six,
nine, twelve; or two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve. One morning after
Jim left she was lying awake counting the window-panes when Harriet
knocked at the door with the hot water. Mildred had not yet gone back to
her aunt, and was sleeping with Beth, Bernadine being with her mother.</p>

<p>"Come, get up, children," said Mrs. Caldwell, as she got out of bed
herself.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mayn't I have breakfast in bed?" said Bernadine in a wheedling
tone.</p>

<p>"No, no, my little body," Mrs. Caldwell answered.</p>

<p>"But, mamma," whined the little body, "I've got such a headache!" She
very often had when she ought to have been getting up.</p>

<p>"Cry, baby, cry," sang out Beth. "Mamma, give me my stockings."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell picked them up off the floor, and gave them to her. Beth
began to put them on in bed, and diverted herself as she did so by
making diabolical grimaces at the malingering imp opposite.</p>

<p>"Mamma," Bernadine whined again, "Beth's teasing me."</p>

<p>"Beth, how often am I to tell you that I will not allow you to tease the
child?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>Beth solemnly gartered her stockings. Then she gave Mildred a dig in the
ribs with her heel, and growled, "Get up!"</p>

<p>"Mamma, Beth is teasing <i>me</i>, now," said Mildred promptly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see why I should be obliged to do all the getting up for
the family," said Beth.</p>

<p>Her mother turned from the looking-glass with her hair-brush in her
hand, and gazed at her sternly. Beth hummed a tune, but kept at a safe
distance until she was dressed, then made her escape, going straight to
the kitchen, where Harriet was cutting bread to toast. "That's all the
bread there is," she said, "and it won't be enough for breakfast if you
eat any."</p>

<p>"All right, then; I haven't any appetite," Beth answered casually. "What
did you dream last night?"</p>

<p>"I dreamt about crocodiles," Harriet averred.</p>

<p>"A crocodile's a reptile," said Beth, "and a reptile is trouble and an
enemy. You always dream nasty things; I expect it's your inside."</p>

<p>"What's that to do wi' it?" said Harriet.</p>

<p>"Everything," said Beth. "Don't you know the stuff that dreams are made
of? Pickles, pork, and plum-cake."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dreams is sent for our guidance," Harriet answered portentously,
shaking her head at Beth's flippancy.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad of it," said Beth, "for I dreamt I was catching Uncle
James's trout in a most unsportsmanlike way, and I guess the dream was
sent to show me how to do it. When I have that kind of dream, I notice
it nearly always comes true. But where's the 'Dream Book'?"</p>

<p>"'Ook it," said Harriet. "'Ere's your ma."</p>

<p>As the other little bodies had their breakfasts in bed, Beth had to face
her lessons alone that morning, and Mrs. Caldwell was not in an amiable
mood; but she was absent as well as irritable, so Beth did some old work
over again, and as she knew it thoroughly, she got on well until the
music began.</p>

<p>Beth had a great talent as well as a great love for music. When they
were at Fairholm, Aunt Grace Mary gave her Uncle James's "Instruction
Book for Beginners" one wet day to keep her quiet, and she learnt her
notes in the afternoon, and began at once to apply them practically on
the piano. She soon knew all the early exercises and little tunes, and
was only too eager to do more; but her mother hated the music-lesson
more than any of the others, and was so harsh that Beth became nervous,
and only ventured on the simplest things for fear of the consequences.
When her mother went out, however, she tried what she liked, and, if she
had heard the piece before, she could generally make something
satisfactory to herself out of it. One day Aunt Victoria found her
sitting on the music-stool, solemnly pulling at her fingers, one after
the other, as though to stretch them.</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you doing, child?" she said.</p>

<p>"O Aunt Victoria," Beth answered in a despairing way, "here's such a
<i>lovely</i> thing, and my head will play it, only my fingers are not long
enough."</p>

<p>Mildred had brought a quantity of new music home with her these
holidays. She promised to play well also, and her aunt was having her
properly taught. Beth listened to her enraptured when she first arrived,
and then, to Mildred's surprise and admiration, tried the pieces
herself, and in a few weeks knew all that it had taken Mildred six
months to learn.</p>

<p>That morning, as ill-luck would have it, when she was waiting at the
piano for her mother to come and give her her lesson, Beth began to try
a piece with a passage in it that she could not play.</p>

<p>"Do show me how to do this," she said when Mrs. Caldwell came.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't do that," Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed. "It is far too
difficult for you."</p>

<p>"But I do so want to learn it," Beth ventured.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," her mother answered. "But I warn you!"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth began, and got on pretty well till she came to the passage she did
not understand, and there she stumbled.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>Beth tried again nervously.</p>

<p>"That's not right," her mother cried. "What does that sign mean? Now,
what is it? Just think!"</p>

<p>Beth, with a flushed face, was thinking hard, but nothing came of it.</p>

<p>"Will you speak?" her mother said angrily. "You are the most obstinate
child that ever lived. Now, say something."</p>

<p>"It's not a shake," Beth ventured.</p>

<p>"A shake!" her mother exclaimed, giving her a hard thump on the back
with her clenched fist. "Now, no more obstinacy. Tell me what it is at
once."</p>

<p>"I don't know that sign," Beth faltered in desperation.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know it!" her mother said, now fairly fuming, and
accompanying every word by a hard thump of her clenched fist. "Then I'll
teach you. I've a great mind to beat you as long as I can stand over
you."</p>

<p>Beth was a piteous little figure, crouched on the piano-stool, her back
bent beneath her mother's blows, and every fibre of her sensitive frame
shrinking from her violence; but she made no resistance, and Mrs.
Caldwell carried out her threat. When she could beat Beth no longer, she
told her to sit there until she knew that sign, and then she left her.
Beth clenched her teeth, and an ugly look came into her face. There had
been dignity in her endurance&mdash;the dignity of self-control; for there
was the force in her to resist, had she thought it right to resist. What
she was thinking while her mother beat her was: "I hope I shall not
strike you back."</p>

<p>Harriet had heard the scolding, and when Mrs. Caldwell had gone she came
and peeped in at the door.</p>

<p>"She's bin' thumpin' you again, 'as she?" she said with a grin. "Wot 'a
ye bin' doin' now?"</p>

<p>"What business is that of yours?" said Beth defiantly. It was bad enough
to be beaten, but it was much worse to have Harriet peeping in to gloat
over her humiliation. Harriet was not to be snubbed, however. She went
up to the piano and looked at the music.</p>

<p>"It's precious hard, I should think," she remarked.</p>

<p>"It's <i>not</i> hard," Beth answered positively, "if anybody tells you what
you don't know and can't make out for yourself. I always remember when
I'm told or shown how to do it; but what's the use of staring at a sign
you've never seen before? Just you look at that! Can you make anything
out of it?" Harriet approached, and, after staring at the sign curiously
for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
 some time, shook her head. "Of course not," said Beth, snatching up
her music, and throwing it on the floor; "and neither can anybody else.
It isn't fair."</p>

<p>Bernadine had begun her lessons by this time in the next room, and Mrs.
Caldwell suddenly began to scold again. "Oh, that awful voice!" Beth
groaned aloud, her racked nerves betraying her.</p>

<p>"She's catchin' it now!" said Harriet, after listening with interest.
She seemed to derive some sort of gratification from the children's
troubles. "But don't you bother any more, Miss Beth.&mdash;Your ma'll 'ave
forgotten all about it by goin'-out time&mdash;or she'll pertend she 'as to
save 'erself trouble. Come and 'elp us wi' the beds."</p>

<p>Beth rose slowly from the piano-stool, and followed Harriet upstairs to
the bedroom at the back of the house. She was at once attracted to the
open window by an uproar of voices&mdash;"the voices of children in happy
play." There was a girls' day-school next door kept by the Misses
Granger. Miss Granger had called on Mrs. Caldwell as soon as she was
settled in her house, to beg for the honour of being allowed to educate
her three little girls, and Beth had assisted at the interview with
serious attention. It would have been the best thing in the world for
her had she been allowed to romp and learn with that careless, happy,
healthy-minded crew of respectable little plebeians; but Mrs. Caldwell
would never have dreamt of sending any of her own superior brood to
associate with such people, even if she could have afforded it. She
politely explained to Miss Granger that she was educating her children
herself for the present; and it was then, with a sickening sense of
disappointment, that Beth rejected her mother's social standard, with
its "vulgar exclusiveness," once for all.</p>

<p>She hung out of the window now, heedless of Harriet's appeals to be
"'elped wi' the beds," and watched the games going on in the next garden
with pathetic gravity. The girls were playing rounders among the old
fruit-trees on the grass-plot, with a loud accompaniment of shrieks and
shouts of laughter. They tumbled up against the trees continually, and
shook showers of autumn leaves down upon themselves; and then, tiring of
the game, they began to pelt each other with the leaves, and laughed and
shrieked still louder. Some of them looked up and made faces at Beth,
but she did not acknowledge the discourtesy. She knew that they were not
ladies, but did not feel, as her mother did, that this was a fault for
which they should be punished, but a misfortune, rather, for which she
pitied them, and she would have liked to have made it up to them by
knowing them. Suddenly she remembered that Aunt Victoria was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> coming
back that day, which was something to look forward to. She took
Harriet's duster, and went to see if the old lady's room was all in
order for her, and arranged as she liked it. Then she returned to the
drawing-room, and sat down on the piano-stool, and rage and rebellion
uprose in her heart. The piece of music still lay on the floor, and she
stamped her foot on it. As she did so, her mother came into the room.</p>

<p>"Do you know your lesson?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"No, I do not," said Beth, and then she doubled her fist, and brought it
down bang on the keyboard.</p>

<p>"How dare you!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed, startled by the vehemence of
the blow, and jarred by the discordant cry of the poor piano.</p>

<p>"I felt I <i>must</i>&mdash;I felt I must make something suffer," said Beth, in a
deep chest-voice and with knitted brows, twisting her fingers and rising
to face her mother as she spoke; "and if I had not struck the piano, I
should have struck <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell could not have been more taken aback if Beth had struck
her. The colour left her face, a chill succeeded the heat of temper, and
her right mind returned as to a drunken man suddenly sobered. She
noticed that Beth's eyes were almost on a level with her own, and once
again she realised that if Beth chose to rebel, she would be powerless
to control her. For some seconds they looked at each other without a
word. Then Beth stooped, picked up the piece of music, smoothed it out,
and put it on the stand; and then she shut up the piano deliberately,
but remained standing in front of it with her back to her mother. Mrs.
Caldwell watched her for a little in silence.</p>

<p>"It's your own fault, Beth," she said at last. "You are so conceited;
you try to play things that are too difficult for you, and then you get
into trouble. It is no pleasure to me to punish you."</p>

<p>Beth remained with her back turned, immovable, and her mother looked at
her helplessly a little longer, and then left the room. When she had
gone, Beth sat down on the piano-stool. Her shabby shoes had holes in
them, her dress was worn thread-bare, and her sleeves were too short for
her. She had no collar or cuffs, and her thin hands and long wrists
looked hideous to her as they lay in her lap. Great tears gathered in
her eyes. So conceited indeed! What had she to be conceited about? Every
one despised her, and she despised herself. Here the tears overflowed,
and Beth began to cry at last, and cried and cried for a long time very
bitterly.</p>

<p>That afternoon, after Aunt Victoria had arrived, Lady Benyon and Aunt
Grace Mary called. Mrs. Caldwell had recovered her good-humour by that
time, and was all smiles to everybody,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
 including Beth, when she came
sauntering in, languid and heavy-eyed, with half a sheet of notepaper in
her hand.</p>

<p>"What have you there, Puck?" said Lady Benyon, catching sight of some
hieroglyph drawn on the paper. Beth gave it to her, and she turned it
this way and that, but could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>"Mamma will tell us what it is," said Beth, taking it to her mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell, still smiling, looked at the drawing. "It's an
astronomical sign, surely," she ventured.</p>

<p>"No, it is not," Beth said.</p>

<p>"Then I don't know what it is," her mother rejoined.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must know, mamma," said Beth. "Look again."</p>

<p>"But I don't know, Beth," Mrs. Caldwell insisted.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make it out if Aunt Victoria beat you?" Beth suggested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell changed countenance.</p>

<p>"That is what you expect me to do, at all events," Beth pursued. "Now,
you see, you can't do it yourself; and I ask you, was it fair to expect
me to make out a strange sign by staring at it?" She set her mouth hard
when she had spoken, and looked her mother straight in the face. Mrs.
Caldwell winced.</p>

<p>"What's the difficulty, Puck?" Lady Benyon asked.</p>

<p>"The difficulty is between me and mamma," Beth answered with dignity,
and then she left the room, sauntering out as she had come in, with an
utterly dispirited air.</p>

<p>The next morning she went to practice as usual, but Mrs. Caldwell did
not come to give her her music-lesson. Beth thought she had forgotten
it, and went to remind her.</p>

<p>"No, Beth, I have not forgotten," said Mrs. Caldwell; "but after your
conduct yesterday, I do not know how you can expect me to give you
another music-lesson."</p>

<p>"Are you not going to give me any more?" Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not," her mother answered.</p>

<p>Beth's heart sank. She stood for some little time in the doorway looking
at her mother, who sat beside the table sewing, and pointedly ignored
her; then Beth turned, and went back to the drawing-room slowly, and
carefully practised the usual time, with great tears trickling down her
cheeks. It did not seem to make much difference what happened, whether
she was on her best behaviour or her worst, the tears were bound to
come. But Beth had a will of her own, and she determined to learn music.
She said no more on the subject to her mother, however, but from that
day forward she practised regularly and hard, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> studied her
instruction books, and listened to other people playing when she had a
chance, and asked to have passages explained to her, until at last she
knew more than her mother could have taught her.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> well-springs, mortal and immortal, were beginning to bubble up
brightly in Beth, despite the hard conditions of her life. She sharpened
her wits involuntarily on the people about her, she gathered knowledge
where she listed; her further faculty flashed forth fine rays at
unexpected intervals to cheer her, and her hungry heart also began to
seek satisfaction. For Beth was by nature well-balanced; there was to be
no atrophy of one side of her being in order that the other might be
abnormally developed. Her chest was not to be flattened because her
skull bulged with the big brain beneath. Rather the contrary. For mind
and body acted and reacted on each other favourably, in so far as the
conditions of her life were favourable. Such congenial intellectual
pursuits as she was able to follow, by tranquillising her, helped the
development of her physique, while the healthy condition of her body
stimulated her to renewed intellectual effort&mdash;and it was all a pleasure
to her.</p>

<p>At this time she had a new experience, an experience for which she was
totally unprepared, but one which helped her a great deal, and delighted
as much as it surprised her.</p>

<p>There were high oak pews in the little church at the end of the road
which the Caldwells attended on Sunday; in the rows on either side of
the main aisle the pews came together in twos, so that when Beth sat at
the end of theirs, as she always did, the person in the next pew sat
beside her with only the wooden partition between. One Sunday, when she
was on her knees, drowsing through the Litany with her cheek on her
prayer-book, she became aware of a boy in the next pew with his face
turned to her in exactly the same attitude. He had bright fair hair
curling crisply, a ruddy fair fat face, and round blue eyes, clear as
glass marbles. Beth was pleased with him, and smiled involuntarily. He
instantly responded to the smile; and then they both got very red; and,
in their delicious shyness, they turned their heads on their
prayer-books, and looked in opposite directions. This did not last long,
however. The desire for another look seized them simultaneously, and
they turned their faces to each other, and smiled again the moment their
eyes met. All through the service they kept looking at each other, and
looking away again; and Beth felt a strange glad glow begin in her chest
and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
spread gradually all over her. It continued with her the whole day;
she was conscious of it throughout the night; and directly she awoke
next morning there it was again; and she could think of nothing but the
apple-cheeked boy, with bright blue eyes and curly fair hair; and as she
dwelt upon his image she smiled to herself, and kept on smiling. There
came upon her also a great desire to please, with sudden energy which
made all effort easy to her, so that, instead of being tiresome at her
lessons, she did them in a way that astonished her mother&mdash;such a
wonderful incentive is a little joy in life. She would not go out when
lessons were over, however, but stood in the drawing-room window
watching the people pass. Harriet came and worried her to help with the
dusting.</p>

<p>"Go away, you chattering idiot," said Beth. She had found Harriet out in
many meannesses by this time, and had lost all respect for her. "Don't
you see I'm thinking? If you don't bother me now I'll help you
by-and-by, perhaps."</p>

<p>On the other side of the road, in the same row as the Benyon
dower-house, but well within sight of the window, was the Mansion-House
Collegiate Day and Boarding School for the Sons of Gentlemen. Beth kept
looking in that direction, and presently the boys came pouring out in
their mortar-boards, and, among them, she soon discovered the one she
was thinking of. She discovered him less by sight than by a strange
sensation in herself, a pleasure which shot through her from top to toe.
For no reason, she stepped back from the window, and looked in the
opposite direction towards the church; but she could see him when he
came bounding past with his satchel of books under his arm, and she also
knew that he saw her. He ran on, however, and going round the corner,
where Orchard Row turned off at an angle out of Orchard Street, was out
of sight in a moment.</p>

<p>But Beth was satisfied. Indeed she was more than satisfied. She ran into
the kitchen, and astonished Harriet by a burst of hilarious spirits, and
a wild demand for food, for a duster, for a scrubbing-brush. She wanted
to do a lot, and she was hungry.</p>

<p>"You're fond, ah think," said Harriet dryly.</p>

<p>"You're fond, too," Beth cried. "We're all fond! The fonder the better!
And I must have something to eat."</p>

<p>"Well, there's nothing for you but bread."</p>

<p>"I must have meat," said Beth. "Rob the joint, and I'll not take any at
dinner."</p>

<p>"Ah'd tak' it w'eniver ah could get it, if ah was you," Harriet advised.</p>

<p>"If you was or were me, you'd do as I do," said Beth; "and <i>I</i> won't
cheat. If I say I won't take it, I won't. I'm entitled to meat once a
day, and I'll take my share now, please; but I won't take more than my
share."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll be 'ungry again by dinner-time."</p>

<p>"I know," said Beth. "But that won't make any difference."</p>

<p>She got out the sirloin of beef which was to be roasted for dinner,
deftly cut some slices off it, fried them with some cold potatoes, and
ate them ravenously, helped by Harriet. When dinner-time came Beth was
ravenous again, but she was faithful to her vow, and ate no meat.
Harriet scoffed at her for her scrupulousness.</p>

<p>The next day, at the same time, Beth was again in the window, waiting
for her boy to come out of the Mansion-House School. When he appeared,
the most delightful thrill shot through her. Her first impulse was to
fly, but she conquered that and waited, watching him. He made straight
for the window, and stopped in a business-like way; and then they
laughed and looked into each other's faces.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" he asked, as if he were accustomed to see
her somewhere else.</p>

<p>"I live here," she said.</p>

<p>"I live in Orchard Row, last house," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"Old Lee's?" Beth inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's my grandfather. I'm Sammy Lee."</p>

<p>"He's a licensed victualler, retired," Beth repeated, drawing upon her
excellent verbal memory.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sammy. "What's yours?"</p>

<p>"I haven't one."</p>

<p>"What's your father?"</p>

<p>"He's dead too."</p>

<p>"What was he?"</p>

<p>"He was a gentleman."</p>

<p>"A retired gentleman?"</p>

<p>"No," said Beth, "an officer and a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sammy. "My father's dead too. He was a retired gentleman."</p>

<p>"What's a retired gentleman?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" Sammy exclaimed. "I thought everybody knew that! When
you make a fortune you retire from business. Then you're a retired
gentleman."</p>

<p>"But gentlemen don't go into business," Beth objected.</p>

<p>"What do they do then?" Sammy retorted.</p>

<p>"They have professions or property."</p>

<p>"It's all the same," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"It isn't," Beth contradicted.</p>

<p>"Yah! <i>you</i> don't know," said Sammy, laughing; and then he ran on, being
late for his dinner.</p>

<p>The discussion had been carried on with broad smiles, and when he left
her, Beth hugged herself, and glowed again, and was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> glad in the thought
of him. But it was not his conversation so much as his appearance that
she dwelt upon&mdash;his round blue eyes, his bright fair curly hair, his
rosy cheeks. "He is beautiful! he is beautiful!" she exclaimed; then
added upon reflection, "<i>And I never thought a boy beautiful before.</i>"</p>

<p>The next day she was making rhymes about him in the acting-room, and
forgot the time, so that she missed him in the morning; but when he left
school in the afternoon she was at the window, and she saw him trotting
up the street as hard as his little legs could carry him.</p>

<p>"Where were you at dinner-time?" he said.</p>

<p>"How funny!" she exclaimed in surprise and delight.</p>

<p>"What's funny?" he demanded, looking about him vaguely.</p>

<p>"You were wanting to see me."</p>

<p>"Who told you so?" Sammy asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You did yourself just now," Beth answered, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>"I didn't."</p>

<p>"You <i>did</i>, Sammy."</p>

<p>"You're a liar!" said Sammy Lee.</p>

<p>"Sammy, that's rude," she exclaimed. "And it's not the way to speak to a
young lady, and I won't have it."</p>

<p>"Well, but I did <i>not</i> tell you I wanted to see you at dinner-time,"
Sammy retorted positively.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, stupid," said Beth. "You asked where I was at
dinner-time, and then I knew you had missed me, and you wouldn't have
missed me if you hadn't wanted to see me."</p>

<p>"But," Sammy repeated with sulky obstinacy, unable to comprehend the
delicate subtilty of Beth's perception,&mdash;"But I did not tell you."</p>

<p>"Didn't you want to see me, then?" Beth said coaxingly, waiving the
other point with tact.</p>

<p>But Sammy, feeling shy at the question and vaguely aggrieved, looked up
and down the street and kicked the pavement with his heel instead of
answering.</p>

<p>"I shall go, then," said Beth, after waiting for a little.</p>

<p>"No, don't," he exclaimed, his countenance clearing. "I want to ask
you&mdash;only you put it out of my head&mdash;gels do talk so."</p>

<p>"Gels!" Beth exclaimed derisively. "I happen to be a girl."</p>

<p>Sammy looked at her with a puzzled expression, and forgot what he was
going to say. She diverted his attention, however, by asking him how old
he was.</p>

<p>"Eleven," Sammy answered promptly.</p>

<p>"So am I. When were you eleven?"</p>

<p>"The twentieth of February."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, then you're older than me&mdash;March, April, May, June&mdash;four months. My
birthday's in June. What do you do at school? Let's see your books. I
wish <i>I</i> went to school!"</p>

<p>"Shu!" said Sammy. "What's the use of sending a gel to school? Gels
can't learn."</p>

<p>"So Jim says," Beth rejoined with an absence of conviction that roused
Sammy.</p>

<p>"All boys say so," he declared.</p>

<p>"All boys are silly," said Beth. "What's the use of saying things? That
doesn't make them true. You're as bad as Jim."</p>

<p>"Who's Jim?" Sammy interrupted jealously.</p>

<p>"Jim's my brother."</p>

<p>Sammy, relieved, kicked his heel on the pavement.</p>

<p>"Which is tallest?" he asked presently, "you or me?"</p>

<p>"I'm tallest, I think," Beth answered; "but never mind. You're the
fattest. I've grown long, and you've grown broad."</p>

<p>"You're mighty sharp," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"You're mighty blunt," said Beth. "And you'll be mighty late for tea,
too. Look at the church-clock!"</p>

<p>Sammy glanced up, then fled precipitately; and Beth, turning to leave
the window, discovered Harriet standing in the background, grinning.</p>

<p>"So you've getten a sweetheart!" she exclaimed. "There's nothing like
beginning early."</p>

<p>"So you've been listening again," Beth answered hotly. "Bad luck to
you!"</p>

<p>A few days later Mrs. Caldwell was sitting with Lady Benyon, who was in
the bow-window as usual, looking out.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken," said Lady Benyon suddenly, "there is a crowd
collecting at your house."</p>

<p>"What! again?" Mrs. Caldwell groaned, jumping up.</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken," Lady Benyon repeated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell hurried off without even waiting to shake hands. On
getting into the street, however, she was relieved to find that Lady
Benyon had been mistaken. There was no crowd collecting in Orchard
Street, but, as she approached her own house, she became aware of a
small boy at the drawing-room window talking to some one within, whom
she presently discovered to be Beth.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there, Beth?" she demanded severely. "Who is this
boy?"</p>

<p>Beth started. "Sammy Lee," she gasped. "Mr. Lee's grandson at the end of
Orchard Row."</p>

<p>"Why are you talking to him?" her mother asked harshly. "I won't have
you talking to him. Who will you scrape acquaintance

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> with next?" Then
she turned to Sammy, who stood shaking in his shoes, with all the rosy
colour faded from his fair fat cheeks, too frightened to stir. "Go
away," said Mrs. Caldwell, "you've no business here talking to my
daughter, and I won't allow it."</p>

<p>Sammy sidled off, not daring to turn his back full till he was at a safe
distance, lest he should be seized from behind and shaken. He was not a
heroic figure in retreat, but Beth, in her indignation, noted nothing
but the insult that had been offered him. For several days, when her
mother was out, she watched and waited for him, anxious to atone; but
Sammy kept to the other side of the road, and only cast furtive smiles
at her as he ran by. It never occurred to Beth that he was less valiant
than she was, or less willing to brave danger for her sake than she was
for his. She thought he was keeping away for fear of getting her into
trouble; and she beckoned to him again and again in order to explain
that she did not care; but he only fled the faster. Then Beth wrote him
a note. It was the first she had ever written voluntarily, and she shut
herself up in the acting-room to compose it, in imitation of Aunt Grace
Mary, whose beautiful delicate handwriting she always did her best to
copy&mdash;with very indifferent success, however, for the connection between
her hand and her head was imperfect. She could compose verses and
phrases long before she could commit them to paper intelligibly; and it
was not the composition of her note to Sammy that troubled her, but her
bad writing. She made a religious ceremony of the effort, praying
fervently, "Lord, let me write it well." Every day she presented a
miscellaneous collection of petitions to the Lord, offering them up as
the necessity arose, being in constant communication with Him. When she
wanted to go out, she asked for fine weather; when she did not want to
go out, she prayed that it might rain. She begged that she might not be
found out when she went poaching on Uncle James's fields; that she might
be allowed to catch something; that new clothes might be sent her from
somewhere, she felt so ashamed in her dirty old shabby ones. She asked
for boots and shoes and gloves, and for help with her lessons; and, when
she had no special petition to offer, she would ejaculate at intervals,
"Lord, send me good luck!" But, however great the variety of her daily
wants, one prayer went up with the others always, "Lord, let me write
well!" meaning, let me write a good hand; yet her writing did not
improve, and she was much disheartened about it. She took the Lord into
her confidence on the subject very frankly. When she had been naughty,
and was not found out and punished, she thanked Him for His goodness;
but why would He not let her write

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
 well? She asked Him the question
again and again, lifting her grey eyes to the grey sky pathetically; and
all the time, though she never suspected it, she was learning to write
more than well, but in a very different sense of the word.</p>

<p>Her note to Sammy was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sammy</span>
,&mdash;Come and talk to me.
Do not be afrade. I do
not mind rows, being always in them. And she can't do
anything to you. I miss you. I want to tell you things.
Such nice things keep coming to me. They make me feel all
comfortable inside. I looked out of the window in the
dark last night. There was a frost. The sky was dark dark
blue like sailor's suits only bright and the stars looked
like holes bored in the floor of heaven to let the light
through. It was so white and bright it must have been the
light of heaven. I never saw such light on earth.
Sunshine is more buffy. Do come Sammy I want you so Beth.
P.S. I can't stop right yet; but I'm trying. It seems
rather difficult to stop: but nobody can write without
stops. I always look at stops in books when I read but
sometimes you put a coma and sometimes a semicollon. I
expect you know but I don't so you must teach me. Its so
nice writing things down. Come to the back gait tonight. </p></div>

<p>When the letter was written in queer, crabbed characters, on one side of
a half-sheet of paper, then folded so that she could write the address
on the other side, because she had no envelope&mdash;she wondered how she
should get it delivered. There was a coolness between her and Harriet.
Beth resented the coarse insinuation about having a sweetheart, and
shrank from hearing any more remarks of a like nature on the subject.
And she couldn't send the letter by post because she had no stamp.
Should she lay it on his doorstep. No, somebody else might get it. How
then? She was standing on her own doorstep with the letter in her pocket
when she asked herself the question, and just at the moment Sammy
himself appeared, coming back from school. Quick as thought, Beth ran
across the road, whipped out the letter and gave it to him. Sammy stood
still in astonishment with his mouth open, gazing at it when he found it
in his hand, as if he could not imagine how it got there.</p>

<p>As soon as it was dark, Beth stationed herself at the back gate, which
looked out into Orchard Street, and waited and waited, but Sammy did not
come. He had not been able to get out; that was it&mdash;she was sure of it;
yet still she waited, although the evening was very cold. Her mother and
Aunt Victoria had gone to dine with Lady Benyon. She did not know what
Harriet was doing, but she had disposed of Bernadine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> for some time to
come by lending her her best picture-book to daub with paint; so it was
pretty safe to wait; and at first the hope of seeing Sammy come running
round the corner was pleasure enough. As the time went on, however, she
became impatient, and at last she ventured a little way up the street,
then a little farther, and then she ran on boldly into Orchard Row. As
she approached the Lees' back-gate, she became aware of a round thing
that looked like a cannon-ball glued to the top, and her fond heart
swelled, for she knew it must be Sammy's head.</p>

<p>"O Sammy! why didn't you come?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I didn't like," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for hours," Beth expostulated with gentle reproach.</p>

<p>"So have I, and it's cold," said Sammy disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Come now. She's out," Beth coaxed.</p>

<p>"So she was the other day," Sammy reminded her.</p>

<p>"But we'll go into the garden. She can't catch us there. It's too dark."</p>

<p>Sammy, half persuaded, ventured out from the gateway, then hesitated.</p>

<p>"But is it <i>very</i> dark?" he said.</p>

<p>"Not so very, when you're used to it," Beth answered. "But it's nice
when it's dark. You can fancy you see things. Come! run!" She seized his
hand as she spoke, and set off, and Sammy, overborne by the stronger
will, kept pace with her.</p>

<p>"But I don't want to see things," he protested, trying to hold back when
they came to the dark passage which led into the garden.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Sammy," said Beth, dragging him on. "I believe you're
a girl."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said Sammy indignantly.</p>

<p>"Then come and sit on the see-saw."</p>

<p>"Oh, have you a see-saw?" he asked, immediately diverted.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;this way&mdash;under the pear-tree. It's a swing, you know, tied to the
branch, and I put this board across it. I pulled the board up out of the
floor of the wood-house. Do you like see-sawing?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sammy with animation.</p>

<p>"Catch hold, then," said Beth, tipping up the board at her end. "What
are you doing, butter-fingers?" she cried, as Sammy failed to catch
hold. "I'm sorry I said you were a girl. You're much too clumsy."</p>

<p>She held the board until Sammy got astride of it at one end, then she
bestrode it herself at the other, and started it with a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> vigorous kick
on the ground. Up and down they went, shaking showers of leaves from the
old tree, and an occasional winter pear, which fell with a thud, being
hard and heavy.</p>

<p>"Golly! this is fine!" Sammy burst out. "I say, Beth, what a jolly sort
of a girl you are!"</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Beth, amply rewarded for all her trouble.</p>

<p>"Yes. And you <i>can</i> write a letter! My! What a time it must 'a' took
you! But, I say, it's all rot about stops, you know. Stops is things in
books. <i>You'd</i> never learn stops."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Beth demanded, bridling.</p>

<p>"Men write books," said Sammy, proud of his sex, "not women, let alone
gels!"</p>

<p>"That's all you know about it, then!" cried Beth, better informed.
"Women <i>do</i> write books, and girls too. Jane Austen wrote books, and
Maria Edgeworth wrote books, and Fanny Burney wrote a book when she was
only seventeen, called 'Evelina' and all the great men read it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Sammy, jeering, "so you're as clever as they are, I suppose!"</p>

<p>Sammy was up in the air as he spoke; the next moment he came down bump
on the ground.</p>

<p>"There," said Beth, "that'll teach you. You be rude again if you dare."</p>

<p>"I'll not come near you again, spit-cat," cried Sammy, picking himself
up.</p>

<p>"I know you won't," Beth rejoined. "You daren't. You're afraid."</p>

<p>"Who's afraid?" said Sammy, blustering.</p>

<p>"Sammy Lee," said Beth. "Oh, Sammy Lee's afraid of me, riding the
see-saw under the tree."</p>

<p>"I say, Beth," said Sammy, much impressed, "did you make that yourself?"</p>

<p>"Make what myself? Make you afraid? Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," said Sammy, plucking up spirit. "I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>"Then don't be a fool," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Fool yourself," Sammy muttered, but not very valiantly.</p>

<p>The church-clock struck nine. They were standing about, Beth not knowing
what to do next, and Sammy waiting for her to suggest something; and in
the meantime the night became colder and the darkness more intense.</p>

<p>"I think I'd better take you home," Beth said at last. "Here, give me
your hand."</p>

<p>She dragged him out of the garden in her impetuous way, and they
scampered off together to Orchard Row, and when they reached

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> the Lees'
house they were so warmed and cheered by the exercise that they parted
from each other in high good-humour.</p>

<p>"I'll come again," said Sammy.</p>

<p>"Do!" said Beth, giving him a great push that sent him sprawling up the
passage. This was the kind of attention he understood, so he went to bed
satisfied.</p>

<p>There was only one great interest in life for the people at Rainharbour.
Their religion gave them but cold comfort; their labour was arduous and
paid them poorly; they had no books, no intellectual pursuits, no games
to take them out of themselves, nothing to expand their hearts as a
community. There were the races, the fair, and the hirings for
excitement, but of pleasure such as satisfies because it is
soul-sustaining and continuous enough to be part of their lives, they
knew nothing. The upper classes were idle, self-satisfied, selfish, and
sensual; the lower were industrious enough, but ignorant, superstitious,
and depressed. The gentry gave themselves airs of superiority, really as
if their characters were as good as their manners; but they did not
impose upon the people, who despised them for their veneer. Each class
displayed its contempt for the other openly when it could safely do so,
but was ready to cringe when it suited its own convenience, the workers
for employment, and the gentry for political purposes. But human beings
are too dependent on each other for such differences to exist without
detriment to the whole community. Society must cohere if it is to
prosper; individuals help themselves most, in the long run, when they
consider each other's interests. At Rainharbour nothing was done to
promote general good fellowship; the kind of Christianity that was
preached there made no mention of the matter, and society was
disintegrated, and would have gone to pieces altogether but for the one
great interest in life&mdash;the great primitive interest which consists in
the attraction of sex to sex. The subject of sweethearts was always in
the air. The minds of boys and girls, youths and maidens, men and women
were all full of it; but it was not often openly discussed as a pleasant
topic&mdash;in fact, not much mentioned at all except for fault-finding
purposes; for it was the custom to be censorious on the subject, and
naturally those were most so who knew most about it, like the vicar, who
had married four times. He was so rabid that he almost went the length
of denouncing men and maidens by name from the pulpit if he caught them
strolling about together in pairs. His mind was so constituted that he
could not believe their dalliance to be innocent, and yet he did not try
to introduce any other interest or pleasure into their lives to divert
them from the incessant pursuit of each other.</p>

<p>It was the grown-up people who were so nasty on the subject of
sweethearts; the boys and girls never could understand why.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> Their own
inclination was to go about together openly in the most public places;
that was how they understood sweethearting; part of the pleasure of it
consisted in other people seeing them, and knowing that they were
sweethearts, and smiling upon them sympathetically. This, however, the
grown-up people never did; on the contrary, they frowned and jeered; and
so the boys and girls kept out of their way, and sought secret sympathy
from each other.</p>

<p>Any little boy at the Mansion-House School who secured a sweetheart
enjoyed a proud distinction, and Sammy soon found that his acquaintance
with Beth placed him in quite an enviable position. He therefore let his
fear of Mrs. Caldwell lapse, and did his best to be seen with Beth as
much as possible. And to her it was a surprise as well as a joy to find
him hanging about, waiting to have a word with her. Her mother's
treatment of her had so damaged her self-respect that she had never
expected anybody to care for her particularly, and Sammy's attentions,
therefore, were peculiarly sweet. She did not consider the position at
all, however. There are subjects about which we think, and subjects upon
which we feel, and the two are quite distinct and different. Beth felt
on the subject of Sammy. The fact of his having a cherubic face made her
feel nice inside her chest&mdash;set up a glow there which warmed and
brightened her whole existence&mdash;a glow which never flickered day or
night, except in Sammy's presence, when it went out altogether more
often than not; only to revive, however, when the real Sammy had gone
and the ideal Sammy returned to his place in her bosom. For Sammy adored
at a distance and Sammy within range of criticism were two very
different people. Sammy adored at a distance was all-ready response to
Beth's fine flights of imagination; but Sammy on the spot was dull. He
was seldom on the spot, however, so that Beth had ample leisure to live
on her love undisturbed, and her mind became extraordinarily active.
Verse came to her like a recollection. On half-holidays they sometimes
went for a walk together over the wild wide waste of sand when the tide
was out, and she would rhyme to herself the whole time; but she seldom
said anything to Sammy. So long as he was silent he was a source of
inspiration&mdash;that is to say, her feeling for him was inspiring; but when
she tried to get anything out of him, they generally squabbled.</p>

<p>Beth lived her own life at this time almost entirely. Since that
startling threat of rebellion, her mother had been afraid to beat her
lest she should strike back; scolding only made her voluble, and Mrs.
Caldwell never thought of trying to manage her in the only way possible,
by reasoning with her and appealing to her better nature. There was,
therefore, but one thing for her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
 mother to do in order to preserve her
own dignity, and that was to ignore Beth. Accordingly, when the
perfunctory lessons were over in the morning, Beth had her day to
herself. She began it generally by practising for at least an hour by
the church-clock, and after that she had a variety of pursuits which she
preferred to follow alone if Sammy were at school, because then there
was no one to interrupt her thoughts. When the larder was empty, she
became Loyal Heart the Trapper, and would wander off to Fairholm to set
snares or catapult anything she could get near. The gun she had found
impracticable, because she was certain to have been seen out with it;
her snares, if they were found, were supposed to have been set by
poachers. She herself was known to every one on the estate, and was
therefore sure of respect, no matter who saw her; even Uncle James
himself would have let her alone had they met, as he was of her mother's
opinion, that it was safer to ignore her than to attempt to control her.
The snares, although of the most primitive kind, answered the purpose.
The great difficulty was how to get the game home; but that she also
managed successfully, generally by returning after dark. Her mother,
concluding that she owed whatever came to Aunt Grace Mary's
surreptitious kindness, said nothing on the subject except to Beth, whom
she supposed to be Aunt Grace Mary's agent; but she very much enjoyed
every addition to her monotonous diet, especially when Beth did the
cooking. In fact, had it not been for Loyal Heart, the family would have
pretty nearly starved that winter, because of Jim, who had contracted
debts like a man, which his mother had to pay.</p>

<p>With regard to Beth's cooking, it is remarkable that, although Mrs.
Caldwell herself had suffered all through her married life for want of
proper training in household matters, she never attempted to have her
own daughters better taught. On the contrary, she had forbidden Beth to
do servant's work, and objected most strongly to her cooking, until she
found how good it was, and even then she thought it due to her position
only to countenance it under protest. The extraordinary inefficiency of
the good-old-fashioned-womanly woman as a wife on a small income, the
silly pretences which showed her want of proper self-respect, and the
ill-adjusted balance of her undeveloped mind which betrayed itself in
petty inconsistencies, fill us with pity and surprise us, yet encourage
us too by proving how right and wise we were to try our own experiments.
If we had listened to advice and done as we were told, the
woman's-sphere-is-home would have been as ugly and comfortless a place
for us to-day as it used to be when Beth was forced by the needs of her
nature to poach for diversion, cook for kindness, and clean, and fight,
and pray, and lie, and love, in her brave struggle against the hard and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
stupid conditions of her life&mdash;conditions which were not only retarding
the development, but threatening utterly to distort, if not actually to
destroy, all that was best, most beautiful, and most wonderful in her
character.</p>

<p>Beth rather expected to get into difficulties eventually about the game,
but she calculated that she would have a certain time to run before her
head was snapped off, and during that time her mother would enjoy her
good dinners and be the better for them, and she herself would enjoy the
sport&mdash;facts which no amount of anger afterwards could alter. Since Mrs.
Caldwell had washed her hands of Beth, they were beginning to be quite
good friends. Sometimes her mother talked to her just as she would to
anybody else; that is to say, with civility. She would say, "And what
are you going to do to-day, Beth?" quite pleasantly, as though speaking
to another grown-up person; and Beth would answer politely, and tell the
truth if possible, instead of making some sulky evasion, as she had
begun to do when there was no other way of keeping the peace. She was
fearlessly honest by nature, but as she approached maturity, she lost
her nerve for a time, and during that time she lied, on occasion, to
escape a harrowing scene. She always despised herself for it, however,
and therefore, as she grew stronger, she became her natural
straightforward self again, only, if anything, all the more scrupulously
accurate for the degrading experience. For she soon perceived that there
is nothing that damages the character like the habit of untruth; the man
or woman who makes a false excuse has already begun to deteriorate. If a
census could be taken to establish the grounds upon which people are
considered noble or ignoble, we should find it was in exact proportion
to the amount of confidence that can be placed first of all in their
sincerity, and then in their accuracy. Sincerity claims respect for
character, accuracy estimation for ability; no high-minded person was
ever insincere, and no fool was ever accurate.</p>

<p>When the close season began, Beth left the plantations, and took to
fishing in the sea. She would sit at the end of the pier in fine
weather, baiting her hooks with great fat lob-worms she had dug up out
of the sands at low tide, and watching her lines all by herself; or, if
it were rough, she would fish in the harbour from the steps up against
the wooden jetty, where the sailors hung about all day long with their
hands in their pockets when the boats were in. Some of them would sit
with her, all in a row, fishing too, and they would exchange bait with
her, and give her good advice, while others stood behind looking on and
listening. And as of old in Ireland she had fascinated the folk, so here
again these great simple bearded men listened with wondering interest to
her talk, and never answered at all as if they were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> speaking to a
child. Beth heard some queer things, sitting down there by the old
wooden jetty, fishing for anything she could catch, and she said some
queer things too when the mood was upon her.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when she wanted to be alone and think, she would go off to
the rocks that appeared at low-water down behind the south pier, and
fish there. She loved this spot; it was near to nature, yet not remote
from the haunts of man. She sat there one afternoon, holding her line,
and dreamily watching the fishing boats streaming across the bay, with
their brown sails set to catch the fitful breeze which she could see
making cat's-paws on the water far out, but could not feel, being
sheltered from it by the old stone pier. The sea was glassy smooth, and
lapped up the rocks, heaving regularly like the breast of a tranquil
sleeper. Beth gazed at it until she was seized with a great yearning to
lie back on its shining surface and be gently borne away to some bright
eternity, where Sammy would be, and all her other friends. The longing
became imperative. She rose from the rock she was sitting on, she raised
her arms, her eyes were fixed. Then it was as if she had suddenly
awakened. The impulse had passed, but she was all shaken by it, and
shivered as if she were cold.</p>

<p>Fortunately the fish were biting well that day. She caught two big dabs,
four whitings, a small plaice, and a fine fat sole. The sole was a
prize, indeed, and mamma and Aunt Victoria should have it for dinner. As
she walked home, carrying the fish on a string, she met Sammy.</p>

<p>"Where did you get those fish?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Caught them," she answered laconically.</p>

<p>"What! all by yourself? No! I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"I did, all the same," she answered; "and now I'm going to cook
them&mdash;some of them at least."</p>

<p>"Yourself? Cook them yourself? No!" he cried in admiration. Cooking was
an accomplishment he honoured.</p>

<p>"If you'll come out after your tea, I'll leave the back-gate ajar, and
you can slip into the wood-house; and I'll bring you a whiting on toast,
all hot and brown."</p>

<p>With such an inducement, Sammy was in good time. Beth found him sitting
contentedly on a heap of sticks, waiting for the feast. She had brought
the whiting out with a cover over it, hot and brown, as she had
promised; and Sammy's mouth watered when he saw it.</p>

<p>"What a jolly girl you are, Beth!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Beth was not so much gratified by the praise as she might have been.
The vision and the dream were upon her that evening, her nerves were
overwrought, and she was yearning for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> an outlet for ideas that
oppressed her. She stood leaning against the door-post, biting a twig;
restless, dissatisfied; but not knowing what she wanted.</p>

<p>When Sammy had finished the whiting, he remembered Beth, and asked what
she was thinking about.</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking exactly," she answered, frowning intently in the
effort to find expression for what she had in her consciousness. "Things
come into my mind, but I don't think them, and I can't say them. They
don't come in words. It's more like seeing them, you know, only you
don't see them with your eyes, but with something inside yourself. Do
you know what it is when you are fishing off the rocks, and there is no
breaking of waves, only a rising and falling of the water; and it comes
swelling up about you with a sort of sob that brings with it a whiff of
fresh air every time, and makes you take in your breath with a sort of
sob too, every time&mdash;and at last you seem to be the sea, or the sea
seems to be you&mdash;it's all one; but you don't think it."</p>

<p>Sammy looked at her in a blank, bewildered way. "I like it best when you
tell stories, Beth," he said, under the impression that all this
incomprehensible stuff was merely a display for his entertainment. "Come
and sit down beside me and tell stories."</p>

<p>"Stories don't come to me to-night," said Beth, with a tragic face. "Do
you remember the last time we were on the sands&mdash;oh! I keep feeling&mdash;it
was all so&mdash;<i>peaceful</i>, that was it. I've been wondering ever since what
it was, and that was it&mdash;peaceful;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The quiet people,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old church steeple;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sandy reaches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wreck-strewn beaches&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Who made that up?" said Sammy suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I did," Beth answered offhand. "At least I didn't make it up, it just
came to me. When I make it up it'll most likely be quite different. It's
like the stuff for a dress, you know, when you buy it. You get it made
up, and it's the same stuff, and it's quite different, too, in a way.
You've got it put into shape, and it's good for something."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you made it up," said Sammy doggedly. "You're stuffing
me, Beth. You're always trying to stuff me."</p>

<p>Beth, still leaning against the door-post, clasped her hands behind her
head and looked up at the sky. "Things keep coming to me faster than I
can say them to-night," she proceeded, paying no heed to his remark;
"not things about you, though, because nothing goes with Sammy but
jammy, clammy, mammy,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
 and those aren't nice. I want things to come
about you, but they won't. I tried last night in bed, and what do you
think came again and again?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Yes, yes, that was his cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While the great clouds went sailing by;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Flashes of crimson on colder sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Like the thoughts of a summer's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Colour'd by love in a life which else were grey.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But that isn't you, you know, Sammy. Then when I stopped trying for
something about you, there came such a singing! What was it? It seems to
have gone&mdash;and yet it's here, you know, it's all here," she insisted,
with one hand on the top of her head, and the other on her chest, and
her eyes straining; "and yet I can't get it."</p>

<p>"Beth, don't get on like that," Sammy remonstrated. "You make me feel
all horrid."</p>

<p>"Make you feel," Beth cried in a deep voice, clenching her fists and
shaking them at him, exasperated because the verses continued to elude
her. "Don't you know what I'm here for? I'm here to make you feel. If
you don't feel what I feel, then you <i>shall</i> feel horrid, if I have to
kill you."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said Sammy, beginning to be frightened. "I shall go away if
you don't."</p>

<p>"Go away, then," said Beth. "You're just an idiot boy, and I'm tired of
you."</p>

<p>Sammy's blue eyes filled with tears. He got down from the heap of
sticks, intent on making his escape; but Beth changed her mind when she
felt her audience melting away.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm going home," he said deprecatingly. "I can't stay if you go on in
that fool-fashion."</p>

<p>"It isn't a fool-fashion," Beth rejoined vehemently. "It's you that's a
fool. I told you so before."</p>

<p>"If you wasn't a girl, I'd punch your 'ead," said Sammy, half afraid.</p>

<p>"I believe you!" Beth jeered. "But you're not a girl, anyway." She flew
at him as she spoke, caught him by the collar, kicked his shins, slapped
his face, and drubbed him on the back.</p>

<p>Sammy, overwhelmed by the sudden onslaught, made no effort to defend
himself, but just wriggled out of her grasp, and ran home, with great
tears streaming down his round red cheeks, and sobs convulsing him.</p>

<p>Beth's exasperation subsided the moment she was left alone in the
wood-house. She sat down on the sticks, and looked straight before her,
filled with remorse.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"What shall I do? What shall I do?" she kept saying to herself. "Oh
dear! oh dear! Sammy! Sammy! He's gone. I've lost him. <i>This is the most
dreadful grief I have ever had in my life.</i>"</p>

<p>The moment she had articulated this full-blown phrase, she became aware
of its importance. She repeated it to herself, reflected upon it, and
was so impressed by it, that she got up, and went indoors to write it
down. By the time she had found pencil and paper, she was the sad
central figure of a great romance, full of the most melancholy
incidents; in which troubled atmosphere she sat and suffered for the
rest of the evening; but she did not think of Sammy again till she went
to bed. Then, however, she was seized anew with the dread of losing him
for ever, and cried helplessly until she fell asleep.</p>

<p>For days she mourned for him without daring to go to the window, lest
she should see him pass by on the other side of the road with scorn and
contempt flashing forth from his innocent blue eyes. In the evening,
however, she opened the back-gate, as usual, and waited in the
wood-house; but he never came. And at first she was in despair. Then she
became defiant&mdash;she didn't care, not she! Then she grew determined. He'd
have to come back if she chose, she'd make him. But how? Oh, she knew!
She'd just sit still till something came.</p>

<p>She was sitting on a heap of beech branches opposite the doorway,
picking off the bronze buds and biting them. The blanched skeleton of
Sammy's whiting, sad relic of happier moments, grinned up at her from
the earthen floor. Outside, the old pear-tree on the left, leafless now
and motionless, showed distinctly in silhouette against the night-sky.
Its bare branches made black bars on the face of the bright white moon
which was rising behind it. What a strange thing time is! day and night,
day and night, week and month, spring, summer, autumn, winter, always
coming and going again, while we only come once, go, and return no more.
It was getting on for Christmas now. Another year had nearly gone. The
years slip away steadily&mdash;day by day&mdash;winter, spring. Winter so cold and
wet; March all clouds and dust&mdash;comes in like a lion, goes out like a
lamb; then April is bright.</p>

<p>The year slips away steadily; slips round the steady year; days come and
go&mdash;no, no! Days dawn and disappear, winters and springs&mdash;springs,
rings, sings? No, leave that. Winter with cold and rain&mdash;pain? March
storms and clouds and pain, till April once again light with it brings.</p>

<p>Beth jumped down from the beech boughs, ran round to the old wooden
pump, clambered up by it on to the back-kitchen roof, and made for the
acting-room window. It was open, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
 she screwed herself in round the
bar and fastened the door. It was quite dark under the sloping roof, but
she found the end of a tallow candle, smuggled up there for the purpose,
lighted it, and stuck it on to the top of the rough deal box which
formed her writing-table. She had a pencil, sundry old envelopes
carefully cut open so as to save as much of the clean space inside as
possible, margins of newspapers, precious but rare half-sheets, and any
other scrap of paper on which she could write, all carefully concealed
in a hole in the roof, from which she tore the whole treasure now in her
haste.</p>

<p>"Winter, summer, Sammy," she kept saying to herself. "Autumn,
autumn-tinted woods&mdash;my king&mdash;<i>Ministering Children</i>&mdash;ministering&mdash;king.
Moon, noon. Story, glory. Ever, never, endeavour. Oh, I can do it! I
can! I can! Slips round the steady year&mdash;"</p>

<p>It took her some days to do it to her satisfaction, but they were days
of delight, for the whole time she felt exactly as she had done when
first she found Sammy. She had the same warm glow in her chest, the same
sort of yearning, half anxious, half pleasant, wholly desirable.</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when she finished, and she had to put her
work away in a hurry, because her mother sent Harriet to tell her she
must go to bed; but all night long she lay only half asleep, and all the
time conscious of joy to come in the morning.</p>

<p>She was up early, but had too much self-restraint to go to the
acting-room till lessons were over. She was afraid of being disturbed
and so having her pleasure spoilt. As soon as she could safely lock
herself up, however, she took her treasure out. It was written on the
precious half-sheets in queer little crabbed characters, very
distinctly:&mdash;</p>

<p>When Beth had read these lines, she doubled the half sheets on which
they were written, and put them in her pocket deliberately. She was
sitting on the acting-room floor at the moment, near the window.</p>

<p>"Now," she exclaimed, folding her delicate nervous hands on her lap, and
looking up at the strip of sky above her, "now I shall be forgiven!"</p>

<p>It was dark at this time when the boys left school in the evening, and
Beth stood at the back-gate waiting to waylay Sammy. He came trotting
along by himself, and saw her as he approached, but did not attempt to
escape. On the contrary, he stopped, but he had nothing to say; the
relief of finding her friendly again was too great for words. Had she
looked out, she might have seen him any day since the event, bright-eyed
and rosy-cheeked as usual, prowling about, anxious to obtain a
reassuring smile from her on his way to and from school. It was not
likely that he would lose the credit of being Beth Caldwell's sweetheart
if he could help it, just because she beat him. Already he had suffered
somewhat in prestige because he had not been seen with her so often
lately; and he had been quite as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
 miserable in his own way, under the
impression that she meant to cast him off, as she had in hers.</p>

<p>"Come in, Sammy," she cried, catching hold of his hand. "Come in, I've
something to show you; but it's too cold to sit in the wood-house, and
we can't have a light there either. Come up by the pump to the
acting-room. I've fastened the door inside, and nobody can get in. Come!
I'll show you the way."</p>

<p>Sammy followed her obediently and in silence, although somewhat
suspiciously as usual; but she piloted him safely, and, once in the
acting-room, with the candle lighted, he owned that it was jolly.</p>

<p>"Sammy, I <i>have</i> been sorry," Beth began. "I've been quite miserable
about&mdash;you know what. It was horrid of me."</p>

<p>"I told you scratch-cats were horrid," said Sammy solemnly.</p>

<p>"But I've done something to atone," Beth proceeded. "Something came to
me all about you. You shall have it, Sammy, to keep. Just listen, and
I'll read it."</p>

<p>Sammy listened with his mouth and eyes open, but when she had done he
shook his head. "You didn't make that up yourself," he said decidedly.</p>

<p>"O Sammy! yes, I did," Beth protested, taken aback and much pained.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe you," said Sammy. "You got it out of a book. You're
always trying to stuff me up."</p>

<p>"I'm not stuffing you, Sammy," said Beth, suddenly flaming. "I made it
myself, every word of it. I tell you it came to me. It's my own. <i>You've
got to believe it.</i>"</p>

<p>Sammy looked about him. There was no escape by the door, because that
led into the house, and Beth was between him and the window, with her
brown hair dishevelled, and her big eyes burning.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, a politic desire to conciliate struggling with an
imperative objection to be stuffed, "of course you made it yourself if
you say so. But it's all rot anyway."</p>

<p>The words slipped out unawares, and the moment he uttered them he ducked
his head: but nothing happened. Then he looked up at Beth, and found her
gazing hard at him, and as she did so the colour gradually left her
cheeks and the light went out of her eyes. Slowly she gathered up her
papers and put them into the hole in the roof. Then she sat on one of
the steps which led down into the room, but she said nothing.</p>

<p>Sammy sat still in a tremor until the silence became too oppressive to
be borne; then he fidgeted, then he got up, and looked longingly towards
the window.</p>

<p>"I shall be late," he ventured.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth made no sign.</p>

<p>"When shall I see you again?" he recommenced, deprecatingly. "Will you
be at the back-gate to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No," she said shortly. "It's too cold to wait for you."</p>

<p>"Then how shall I see you?" he asked, with a blank expression.</p>

<p>Beth reflected. "Oh, just whistle as you pass," she said at last, in an
offhand way, "and I'll come out if I feel inclined."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The next evening Mrs. Caldwell was taking her accustomed nap after
dinner in her arm-chair by the fire in the dining-room, and Beth was
sitting at the table dreaming, when she was suddenly startled by a long,
loud, shrill whistle. Another and another of the most piercing quality
followed in quick succession. Swiftly but cautiously she jumped up, and
slipped into the drawing-room, which was all in darkness. There were
outside shutters to the lower windows, but the drawing-room ones were
not closed, so she looked out, and there was Sammy, standing with his
innocent fat face as close to the dining-room shutters as he could hold
it, with his fingers in his mouth, uttering shrill whistles loud and
long and hard and fast enough to rouse the whole neighbourhood. Beth,
impatient of such stupidity, returned to the dining-room and sat down
again, leaving Sammy to his fate.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Caldwell started wide awake.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> that noise, Beth?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It seems to be somebody whistling outside," Beth answered in deep
disgust. Then her exasperation got the better of her self-control, and
she jumped up, and ran out to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Harriet," she said between her clenched teeth, "go out and send that
silly fool away."</p>

<p>Harriet hastened to obey; but at the opening of the front door, Sammy
bolted.</p>

<p>The next evening he began again, however, as emphatically as before; but
Beth could not stand such imbecility a second time, so she ran out of
the back-gate, and seized Sammy.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" she cried, shaking him.</p>

<p>"Why, you told me to whistle," Sammy remonstrated, much aggrieved.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you to whistle like a railway engine?" Beth demanded
scornfully. "You've no sense at all, Sammy. Go away!"</p>

<p>"Oh, do let's come in, Beth," Sammy pleaded. "I've something to tell
you."</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Beth ungraciously.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you if you'll let me come in."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, come then," Beth answered impatiently, and led the way up over
the roof to the acting-room. "What is it?" she again demanded, when she
had lighted a scrap of candle and seated herself on the steps. "I don't
believe it's anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, so there!" said Sammy triumphantly. "But I'll lay you won't
guess what it is. Mrs. Barnes has got a baby."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barnes was the wife of the head-master of the Mansion-House School,
and all the little boys, feeling that there was more in the event than
had been explained to them, were vaguely disgusted.</p>

<p>"I don't call that anything," Beth answered contemptuously. "Lots of
people have babies."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sammy, "I wouldn't have thought it of him."</p>

<p>"Thought what of whom?" Beth snapped in a tone which silenced Sammy. He
ventured to laugh, however.</p>

<p>"Don't laugh in that gigantic way, Sammy," she exclaimed, still more
irritated. "When you throw back your head and open your mouth so wide, I
can see you have no wisdom-teeth."</p>

<p>"You're always nasty now, Beth," Sammy complained.</p>

<p>Which was true. Love waning becomes critical. Beth's own feeling for
Sammy had been a strong mental stimulant at first, and, in her enjoyment
of it, she had overlooked all his shortcomings. There was nothing in
him, however, to keep that feeling alive, and it had gradually died of
inanition. His slowness and want of imagination first puzzled and then
provoked her; and, little-boy-like, he had not even been able to respond
to such tenderness as she showed him&mdash;not that she had ever showed him
much tenderness, for they were just like boys together. She had kissed
him, however, once or twice, after a quarrel, to make it up; but she did
not like kissing him: little boys are rank. His pretty colouring was all
that he had had to attract her, and that, alas! had lost its charm by
this time. For a little longer she looked out for him and troubled about
him, then let him go gradually&mdash;so gradually, that she never knew when
exactly he lapsed from her life altogether.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two years after Beth was outlawed by
her mother, Great-Aunt Victoria
Bench was her one link with the civilised world. The intimacy had lapsed
a little while Sammy was the prevailing human interest in Beth's life,
but gradually as he ceased to be satisfactory, she returned to the old
lady, and hovered about her, seeking the sustenance for which her poor
little heart ached on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
 always, and for want of which her busy brain ran
riot; and the old lady, who had not complained of Beth's desertion,
welcomed her back in a way which showed that she had felt it.</p>

<p>For Great-Aunt Victoria Bench was lonely in the days of her poverty and
obscurity. Since the loss of her money, there had been a great change in
the attitude of most of her friends towards her, and such attentions as
she received were of a very different kind from those to which she had
been accustomed. Mrs. Caldwell had been the most generous to her, for at
the time that she had offered Aunt Victoria a home in her house, she had
not known that the old lady would be able to pay her way at all.
Fortunately Aunt Victoria had enough left for that, but still her
position in Mrs. Caldwell's house was not what it would have been had
she not lost most of her means. Mrs. Caldwell was not aware of the fact,
but her manner had insensibly adjusted itself to Aunt Victoria's altered
circumstances, her care and consideration for her being as much reduced
in amount as her income; and Aunt Victoria felt the difference, but said
nothing. Slowly and painfully she learnt to realise that it was for what
she had had to bestow, and not for what she was, that people used to
care; they had served her as they served their God, in the hope of
reaping a rich reward. Like many other people with certain fine
qualities of their own, Aunt Victoria knew that there was wickedness in
the outside world, but never suspected that her own immediate circle,
the nice people with whom she talked pleasantly every day, could be
tainted; and the awakening to find that her friends cared less
disinterestedly for her than she did for them was a cruel disillusion.
Her first inclination was to fly far from them all, and spend the rest
of her days amongst strangers who could not disappoint her because she
would have nothing to expect of them, and who might perhaps come to care
for her really. Long hours she sat and suffered, shut up in her room,
considering the matter, yearning to go, but restrained by the fear that,
as an old woman, she would be unwelcome everywhere. In Aunt Victoria's
day old people were only too apt to be selfish, tyrannical, narrow, and
ignorant, a terror to their friends; and they were nearly always ill,
the old men from lives of self-indulgence, and the old women from
unwholesome restraint of every kind. Now we are beginning to ask what
becomes of the decrepit old women, there are so few to be seen. This is
the age of youthful grandmothers, capable of enjoying a week of their
lives more than their own grandmothers were able to enjoy the whole of
their declining years; their vitality is so much greater, their
appearance so much better preserved; their knowledge so much more
extensive, their interests so much more varied, and their hearts so much
larger. Aunt Victoria nowadays would have struck out for herself in a
new direction.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
 She would have gone to London, joined a progressive
women's club, made acquaintance with work of some kind or another, and
never known a dull moment; for she would have been a capable woman had
any one of her faculties been cultivated to some useful purpose; but as
it was, she had nothing to fall back upon. She was just like a domestic
animal, like a dog that has become a member of the family, and is
tolerated from habit even after it grows old, and because remarks would
be made if it were put out of the way before its time; and she had been
content with the position so long as much was made of her. Now, however,
all too late, a great yearning had seized upon her for an object in
life, for some pursuit, some interest that would remain to her when
everything else was lost; and she prayed to God earnestly that He would
show her where to go and what to do, or give her something&mdash;something
which at last resolved itself into something to live for.</p>

<p>Then one day there came a little resolute tap at the door, and Beth
walked in without waiting to be asked, and seeing in a moment with that
further faculty of hers into the old lady's heart that it was sad, she
went to her impulsively, and laid her unkempt brown head against her arm
in an awkward caress, which touched the old lady to tears. Beth was
lonely too, thought Aunt Victoria, a strange, lonely little being,
neglected, ill-used, and misunderstood, and the question flashed through
the old lady's mind, if she left the child, what would become of her?
The tangled brown head, warm against her arm, nestled nearer, and Aunt
Victoria patted it protectingly.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything, Beth?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt Victoria. I just wanted to see you. I was lying on the see-saw
board, looking up through the leaves, and I suddenly got a fancy that
you were here all by yourself, and that you didn't like being all by
yourself. <i>I</i> feel like that sometimes. So I came to see you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Beth," said Aunt Victoria, with her hand still on Beth's
head as if she were blessing her; and when she had spoken she looked up
through the window, and silently thanked the Lord. This was the sign. He
had committed Beth to her care and affection, and she was not to think
of herself, but of the child, whose need was certainly the greater of
the two.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to do, Beth?" she said after a pause.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt Victoria," Beth answered drearily&mdash;"at least there are plenty
of things I could do, but everything I think of makes me shudder. I feel
so sometimes. Do you? There isn't a single thing I want to do to-day.
I've tried one thing after the other, but I can't think about what I'm
doing. Sometimes I like to sit still and do nothing; but to-day I don't
even like that. I think

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
 I should like to be asked to do something. If I
could do something for you now&mdash;something to help you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you can, Beth," Aunt Victoria answered, after sitting rigidly
upright for a moment, blinking rapidly. "Help me to unpick an old gown.
I am going to make another like it, and want it unpicked for a pattern."</p>

<p>"Can you make a gown?" Beth asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria smiled. Then she took down an old black gown that was
hanging behind the door, and handed it to Beth with a pair of sharp
scissors.</p>

<p>"I'll undo the body part," Beth said, "and that will save your eyes. I
don't think this gown owes you much."</p>

<p>"I do not understand that expression, Beth," said Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>"Don't you," said Beth, working away with the scissors cheerfully.
"Harriet always says that, when she's got all the good there is to be
got out of anything&mdash;the dusters, you know, or the dishcloth. I once
did a piece of unpicking like this for mamma, and she didn't explain
properly, or something&mdash;at all events, I took out a great deal too much,
so she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't call your mamma 'she.' 'She' is the cat."</p>

<p>"Mamma, then. Mamma beat me."</p>

<p>"Don't say she beat you."</p>

<p>"I said mamma."</p>

<p>"Well, don't talk about your mamma beating you. That is not a nice thing
to talk about."</p>

<p>"It's not a nice thing to do either," said Beth judicially. "And I never
used to talk about it; didn't like to, you know. But now
she&mdash;mamma&mdash;doesn't beat me any more&mdash;at least only sometimes when she
forgets."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, you have been a better girl."</p>

<p>"No, not better&mdash;bigger. You see if I struck her back again she wouldn't
like it."</p>

<p>"Beth! Beth! strike your mother!"</p>

<p>"That was the danger," said Beth, in her slow, distinct, imperturbable
way. "One day she made me so angry I very nearly struck her, and I told
her so. That made her look queer, I can tell you. And she's never struck
me since&mdash;except in a half-hearted sort of way, or when she forgot, and
that didn't count, of course. But I think I know now how it was she used
to beat me. I did just the same thing myself one day. I beat Sammy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is Sammy?" said Aunt Victoria, looking over her spectacles.</p>

<p>"Sammy Lee, you know."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria recollected, and felt she should improve the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> occasion,
but was at a loss for a moment what to say. She was anxious above
everything that Beth should talk to her freely, for how could she help
the child if she did not know all she had in her mind? It is upon the
things they are never allowed to mention that children brood
unwholesomely.</p>

<p>"I thought that you were not allowed to know Sammy Lee," she finally
observed.</p>

<p>"No more I was," Beth answered casually.</p>

<p>"Yet you knew him all the same?" Aunt Victoria ventured reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria," said Beth, "did the Lord die for Sammy?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes," said Aunt Victoria, hesitating, not because she doubted the
fact, but because she did not know what use Beth would make of it.</p>

<p>"Then why can't <i>I</i> know him?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, be&mdash;because Sammy does not live as if he were grateful to the
Lord."</p>

<p>"If he did, would he be a gentleman?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Aunt Victoria answered decidedly.</p>

<p>Beth stopped snipping, and looked at her as if she were looking right
through her, and out into the world beyond. Then she pursed up her mouth
and shook her head.</p>

<p>"That won't hold water," she said. "If a man must live like the Lord to
be a gentleman, what is Uncle James? And if living like the Lord makes a
man a gentleman, why don't we call on old Job Fisher?"</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria began to fear that the task she had undertaken would prove
too much for her. "It is hard, very hard," she muttered.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said Beth, resuming her work. "When I grow up I mean
to write about things like that. But what were we talking about? Oh,
beating Sammy. I did feel bad after I beat him, and I vowed I'd never do
it again however tiresome he was, and I never did. It makes it easier if
you vow. It's just as if your hands were tied then. I'd like to tell
mamma to try it, only she'd be sure to get waxy. You tell her, Aunt
Victoria."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria made some reply which was lost in the noise of vehicles
passing in the street, followed by the tramp of many feet and a great
chattering. An excursion train had just arrived, and the people were
pouring into the place. Beth ran to the window and watched them.</p>

<p>"More confounded trippers," she ejaculated. "They spoil the summer,
swarming everywhere."</p>

<p>"Beth, I wish, to please me, you would make another vow. Don't say
'confounded trippers.'"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Aunt Victoria. Jim says it. But I know all the bad words in
the language were made for the men. I suppose because they have all the
bad thoughts, and do all the bad things. I shall say 'objectionable
excursionists' in future." She went to the door. "I'm just going to get
something," she said. "You won't go away now, will you? I shall be a
minute or two, but I want you to be here when I come back. I shall be
wild if you're not."</p>

<p>She banged the door after her and ran downstairs.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria looked round the room; it no longer seemed the same place
to her. Beth's cheerful chatter had already driven away the evil spirit
of dejection, and taken the old lady out of herself. Untidy child! She
had left her work on the floor, her scissors on the bed, disarranged the
window-curtain, and upset a chair. If she would not do any more
unpicking when she returned, she must be made to put things straight.
There was one little easy-chair in the room. Aunt Victoria sat down in
it, a great piece of self-indulgence for her at that time of day, folded
her hands, and closed her weary old eyes just to give them a rest, while
a nice little look of content came into her face, which it was good to
see there.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes again, Beth was setting a tray on a tiny table
beside her.</p>

<p>"I think you've been having a nap, Miss Great-Aunt Victoria Bench," she
said. "Now, have some tea! and buttered toast!!"</p>

<p>"O Beth!" cried the old lady, beaming. "How could you&mdash;at this time of
day? Well, to please you. It is quite delicious. So refreshing. What,
another piece of toast! Must I take another?"</p>

<p>"You must take it all," said Beth. "I made it for you. I do like doing
things for you, Aunt Victoria. It makes me feel nice all over. I'll just
unpick a little more. Then I'll tidy up."</p>

<p>"You're a good child to think of that," said Aunt Victoria. "I did not
think you would."</p>

<p>"Didn't you?" said Beth. "How funny! But I like things tidy. I often
tidy up."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I suppose Harriet says tidy up," the old lady observed gently, not
liking to be censorious at this happy moment of relaxation, but still
anxious to do her duty. Beth understood her perfectly and smiled.</p>

<p>"I like you to tell me when I say things wrong," she said; "and I like
to know how Harriet talks too. You can't write if you don't know how
every one talks."</p>

<p>"What are you going to write?" Aunt Victoria asked, taking up another
piece of buttered toast.</p>

<p>"Oh, books," Beth answered casually.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Write something soul-sustaining then, Beth," said Aunt Victoria. "Try
to make all you say soul-sustaining. And never use a word you would be
ashamed to hear read aloud."</p>

<p>"You mean like those things they read in church?" said Beth. "I don't
think I ever could use such words. When Mr. Richardson comes close to
them, I get hot all over and hate him. But I promise you, Aunt Victoria,
I will never write anything worse than there is in the Bible. There's a
man called Ruskin who writes very well, they say, and he learnt how to
do it from reading the Bible. His mother taught him when he was a little
boy, just as you taught me. I always read the Bible&mdash;search the
Scriptures&mdash;every day. You say it's a sacred book, don't you, Aunt
Victoria? Harriet says it's smutty."</p>

<p>"Says <i>what</i>?" Aunt Victoria exclaimed, sitting bolt upright in her
horror. "What does she mean by such an expression?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she just means stories like Joseph and Potiphar's wife, David and
Bathsheba, Susanna and the elders."</p>

<p>"My <i>dear</i> child!" Aunt Victoria gasped.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Victoria, they're all in the Bible, at least Susanna and the
elders isn't. That's in the Apocrypha."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria sat silent a considerable time. At last she said solemnly:
"Beth, I want you to promise me one thing solemnly, and that is that all
your life long, whatever may be before you, whatever it may be your lot
to learn, you will pray to God to preserve your purity."</p>

<p>"What is purity?" said Beth.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria hesitated: "It's a condition of the mind which keeps us
from ever doing or saying anything we should be ashamed of," she finally
decided.</p>

<p>"But what kind of things?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Aunt Victoria was not equal to the occasion. She blinked
her eyes very hard, sipped some tea, and left Beth to find out for
herself, according to custom.</p>

<p>"We must only talk about nice things," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't care to talk nastily about people as Lady Benyon does
sometimes," Beth rejoined.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, that is not a nice thing to say about Lady Benyon."</p>

<p>"Isn't it?" said Beth, then added: "Oh dear, how funny things are!"
meaning how complicated.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this tea, Beth?" said Aunt Victoria. "It is very
good, and I feel so much the better for it."</p>

<p>"I thought you wanted something," said Beth. "Your face went all queer.
That means people want something. I got the tea out of the
store-cupboard. It has a rotten lock. If you shake it, it comes open."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what does your mamma say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she never notices. Or, if she does, she thinks she left it open
herself. Harriet has a little sometimes. She takes it because she says
mamma should allow her a quarter of a pound of dry tea a week, so it
isn't stealing. And I took it for you because you pay to live here, so
you're entitled to the tea. I don't take it for myself, of course. But
I'm afraid I oughtn't to have told you about Harriet. I'm so sorry. It
slipped out. It wasn't sneaking. But I trust to your honour, Aunt
Victoria. If you sneaked on Harriet, I could never trust you again, now
could I?" She got up as she spoke, folded her work, picked up the chair,
arranged the window-curtain, moved the tray, and put the table back in
its place, at the same time remarking: "I shall take these things
downstairs now, and go for a run."</p>

<p>She left Aunt Victoria with much to reflect upon. The glimpse she had
accidentally given the old lady of Harriet's turpitude had startled her
considerably. Mrs. Caldwell had always congratulated herself on having
such a quiet respectable person in the house as Harriet to look after
Beth, and now it appeared that the woman was disreputable both in her
habits and her conversation, the very last person whom a girl, even of
such strongly marked individuality as Beth, should have been allowed to
associate with intimately. But what ought Miss Victoria to do? If she
spoke to Mrs. Caldwell, Beth would never forgive her, and the important
thing was not to lose Beth's confidence; but if she did not speak to
Mrs. Caldwell, would she be doing right? Of course, if Mrs. Caldwell had
been a different sort of person, her duty would have been clear and
easy; but as it was, Aunt Victoria decided to wait.</p>

<p>The next day Beth returned of her own accord to finish the unpicking.
She wanted to know what "soul-sustaining" meant; and in ten minutes she
had cross-questioned Aunt Victoria into such a state of confusion that
the old lady could only sit silently praying to Heaven for guidance. At
last she got up, and took a little packet out of one of her trunks. She
had to live in her boxes because there was no closet or wardrobe or
chest of drawers in the room.</p>

<p>"See, Beth," she said, "here is some tea and sugar. I don't think it
nice of you to go to your mother's cupboard without her leave. That's
rather a servant's trick, you know, and not honest; so give it up, like
a dear child, and let us have tea together, you and I, up here, when we
want it. I very much enjoy a good cup of tea, it is so refreshing, and
you make it beautifully."</p>

<p>Beth changed colour and countenance while Aunt Victoria was speaking,
and she sat for some time afterwards looking fixedly at the empty grate;
then she said, "You always tell me

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
 things nicely, Aunt Victoria; that's
what I like about you. I'll not touch the cupboard again, I vow; and if
you catch me at any other 'servant's tricks' just you let me know."</p>

<p>The old lady's heart glowed. The Lord was showing her how to help the
child.</p>

<p>But the holidays were coming on; she would have to go away to make room
for the boys; and she dreaded to leave Beth at this critical time, lest
she should relapse, just as she was beginning to form nice feminine
habits. For Beth had taken kindly to the sewing and tea-drinking and
long quiet chats; it was a delight to her to have some one to wait on,
and help, and talk to. "I'm so fond of you, Aunt Victoria," she said one
day; "I even like you to snap at me; and if we lived quite alone
together, you and I, I should do everything for you."</p>

<p>"Would you like to come away with me these holidays?" said Aunt
Victoria, seized suddenly with a bright idea.</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't I!" said Beth. "But then, the expense!"</p>

<p>"I think I can manage it, if your mamma has no objection," said Aunt
Victoria, nodding and blinking, and nodding again, as she calculated.</p>

<p>"I should think mamma would be only too glad to get rid of me," said
Beth hopefully.</p>

<p>And she was not mistaken.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next few weeks, in their effect upon Beth's character, were among
the most important of her life. She did not know until the day before
where she was to go with Aunt Victoria. It was the habit of the family
to conceal all such arrangements from the children, and indeed from each
other as much as possible. Aunt Victoria observed that Caroline was
singularly reticent, and Mrs. Caldwell complained that Aunt Victoria
made a mystery of everything. It was a hard habit, which robbed Beth of
what would have been so much to her, something to look forward to. Since
she knew that she was to go somewhere, however, she had lived upon the
idea; her imagination had been busy trying to picture the unknown place,
and her mind full of plans for the comfort of Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>It was after breakfast one day, while her mother and Aunt Victoria were
still at table, that the announcement was made. "You need not do any
lessons this morning, children," Mrs. Caldwell said. "Beth is going to
Harrowgate with Aunt Victoria to-morrow, and I must see to her things
and get them packed."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>Aunt Victoria looked round at Beth with a carefully restrained smile,
expecting some demonstration of joy. Beth was standing in the window
looking out, and turned with a frown of intentness on her face when her
mother mentioned Harrowgate, as if she were trying to recall something.</p>

<p>"Harrowgate!" she said slowly. "<i>Harrowgate!</i>"</p>

<p>"Beth, do not frown so," Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed irritably. "You'll be
all wrinkled before you're twenty."</p>

<p>Beth gazed at her solemnly without seeing her, then fixed her eyes upon
the ground as if she were perusing it, and began to walk slowly up and
down with her head bent, her hands clasped behind her, her curly brown
hair falling forward over her cheeks, and her lips moving.</p>

<p>"What is it you're muttering, child?" Aunt Victoria asked.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to think," Beth rejoined.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"''Twas in the prime of summer time,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">"'I took the dreary body up.'...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ah, I know&mdash;I have it!" she exclaimed joyfully, and with a look of
relief; "Harrowgate&mdash;Knaresboro'&mdash;the cave there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Two stern-faced

<span class="i2">And Eugene Aram walked between,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With gyves upon his wrist.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"My dear child," said Aunt Victoria sternly, "what is it you are trying
to say? and how often are you to be told not to work yourself up into
such a state of excitement about nothing?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know about Eugene Aram, Aunt Victoria?" Beth rejoined with
concern, as if not to know about Eugene Aram were indeed to have missed
one of the great interests of life. Then she sat down at the table with
her elbows resting on it, and her delicate oval face framed in her
slender hands, and gave Aunt Victoria a graphic sketch of the story from
Bulwer Lytton.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Caroline," said Aunt Victoria, greatly horrified, "is it
possible that you allow your children to read such books?"</p>

<p>"I read such books to my children myself when I see fit,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> Mrs. Caldwell
rejoined. "I may be allowed to judge what is good for them, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Good for them!" Aunt Victoria ejaculated. "Accounts of murder, theft,
and executions!"</p>

<p>"But why not, Aunt Victoria?" Beth put in. "Why not read about Eugene
Aram as well as about Barabbas?"</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria looked so shocked, however, at the mention of Barabbas in
this connection, that Beth broke off and hastened to add for the relief
of the old lady's feelings&mdash;"Only of course Barabbas was a sacred sort
of thief, and that is different."</p>

<p>On the journey next day a casual remark let fall by a stranger made a
curious impression upon Beth. They were travelling second-class, and
Aunt Victoria, talking to another lady in the carriage, happened to
mention that Beth was twelve years old. A gentleman, the only other
passenger, who was sitting opposite to Beth, looked up at her over his
newspaper when her age was mentioned, and remarked&mdash;"Are you only
twelve? I should have thought you were older. Rather nice-looking too,
only freckled."</p>

<p>Beth felt her face flush hotly, and then she laughed. "Nice-looking!
Nice-looking!" She repeated the words to herself again and again, and
every time they recurred to her, she lost countenance in spite of
herself, and laughed and flushed, being strangely surprised and pleased.</p>

<p>It was that remark that first brought home to Beth the fact that she had
a personal appearance at all. Hitherto she had thought very little of
herself. The world without had been, and always would be, much more to
her than the world within. She was not to be one of those narrow,
self-centred, morbid beings whose days are spent in introspection, and
whose powers are wasted in futile efforts to set their own little
peculiarities forth in such a way as to make them seem of consequence.
She never at any time studied her own nature, except as a part of human
nature, and in the hope of finding in herself some clue which would help
her to a sympathetic understanding of other people.</p>

<p>Great-Aunt Victoria Bench, in these days of her poverty, lodged with an
old servant of the family, who gave her for ten shillings a week a
bedroom at the top of the house, and a little sunny sitting-room on the
ground-floor at the back, looking out into an old-fashioned garden, full
of flowers such as knights in olden times culled for their ladies. The
little sitting-room was furnished with Chippendale chairs, and a little
Chippendale sideboard with drawers, and a bookcase with glass doors
above and a cupboard below, in which Aunt Victoria used to keep her
stores of tea, coffee, sugar, and currants in mustard-tins. Beth heard
with surprise that the hearthrug was one which Aunt Victoria

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> had worked
herself as a present for Prentice when she married. Prentice was now
Mrs. Pearce, but Aunt Victoria always called her Prentice. The hearthrug
was like a Turkey carpet, only softer, deeper, and richer. Aunt Victoria
had sat on Chippendale chairs in her youth, and she was happy amongst
them. When she sat down on one she drew herself up, disdaining the stiff
back and smiled and felt young again, while her memory slipped away to
pleasant days gone by; and Mrs. Pearce would come and talk to her,
standing respectfully, and reminding her of little things which Aunt
Victoria had forgotten, or alluding with mysterious nods and shakings of
the head to other things which Beth was not to hear about. When this
happened Beth always withdrew. She was becoming shy of intruding now,
and delicate about overhearing anything that was not intended for her;
and when she had gone on these occasions, the two old ladies would nod
and smile to each other, Prentice in respectful approval, and Aunt
Victoria in kindly acknowledgment. Prentice wore a cap and front like
Aunt Victoria, but of a subdued brown colour, as became her humble
station.</p>

<p>Beth took charge of the housekeeping as soon as they arrived, made tea,
arranged the groceries in the cupboard, and put the key in her pocket;
and Aunt Victoria, who was sitting upright on a high Chippendale chair,
knitting, and enjoying the dignity of the old attitude after her
journey, looked on over her spectacles in pleased approval. Before they
went to bed, they read the evening psalms and lessons together in the
sitting-room, and Aunt Victoria read prayers. When they went upstairs
they said their private prayers, kneeling beside the bed, and Aunt
Victoria made Beth wash herself in hot water, and brush her hair for
half-an-hour. Aunt Victoria attributed her own slender, youthful figure
and the delicate texture of her skin to this discipline. She said she
had preserved her figure by never relaxing into languid attitudes, and
her complexion by washing her face in hot water with fine white soap
every night, and in cold water without soap every morning. She did not
take her fastidious appetite into consideration, nor her simple, regular
life, nor the fact that she never touched alcohol in any shape or form,
nor wore a tight or heavy garment, nor lost her self-control for more
than a moment whatever happened, but Beth discovered for herself, as she
grew older, that these and that elevated attitude of mind which is
religion, whatever the form preferred to express it, are essential parts
of the discipline necessary for the preservation of beauty.</p>

<p>In the morning Beth made breakfast, and when it was over, if crusts had
accumulated in the cupboard, she steeped them in hot milk in a pie-dish,
beat them up with an egg, a little butter, sugar, currants, and candied
peel, and some nutmeg grated, for a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
 bread-pudding, which Prentice took
out to bake for dinner, remarking regularly that little miss promised to
be helpful, to which Aunt Victoria as regularly responded Yes, she hoped
Miss Beth would become a capable woman some day.</p>

<p>After breakfast they read the psalms and lessons together, verse by
verse, and had some "good talk," as Beth called it. Then Aunt Victoria
got out an old French grammar and phrase-book, a copy of "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque,"
and a pocket-dictionary, treasured possessions which she always carried
about with her, and had a kind of pride in. French had been her
speciality, but these were the only French books she had, and she
certainly never spoke the language. She would have shrunk modestly from
any attempt to do so, thinking such a display almost as objectionable as
singing in a loud professional way instead of quietly, like a well-bred
amateur, and showing a lack of that dignified reserve and general
self-effacement which she considered essential in a gentlewoman.</p>

<p>But she was anxious that Beth should be educated, and therefore the
books were produced every morning. Mrs. Caldwell had tried in vain to
teach Beth anything by rule, such as grammar. Beth's memory was always
tricky. Anything she cared about she recollected accurately; but
grammar, which had been presented to her not as a means to an end but as
an end in itself, failed to interest her, and if she remembered a rule
she forgot to apply it, until Aunt Victoria set her down to the old
French books, when, simply because the old lady looked pleased if she
knew her lesson and disturbed if she did not, she began at the beginning
of her own accord, and worked with a will&mdash;toilsomely at first, but by
degrees with pleasure as she proceeded, and felt for the first time the
joy of mastering a strange tongue.</p>

<p>"You learnt out of this book when you were a little girl, Aunt Victoria,
didn't you?" she said, looking up on the day of the first lesson. She
was sitting on a high-backed chair at one end of the table, trying to
hold herself as upright as Aunt Victoria, who sat at the other and
opposite end to her, pondering over her knitting. "I suppose you hated
it."</p>

<p>"No, I did not, Beth," Aunt Victoria answered severely. "I esteemed it a
privilege to be well educated. Our mother could not afford to have us
all instructed in the same accomplishments, and so she allowed us to
choose French, or music, or drawing and painting. <i>I</i> chose French."</p>

<p>"Then how was it grandmamma learned drawing and painting, and playing,
and everything?" Beth asked. "Mamma knows tunes she composed."</p>

<p>"Your dear grandmamma was an exceedingly clever girl,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> Aunt Victoria
answered stiffly, as if Beth had taken a liberty when she asked the
question; "and she was the youngest, and desired to learn all we knew,
so we each did our best to impart our special knowledge to her. <i>I</i>
taught her French."</p>

<p>"How strange," said Beth; "and out of this very book? And she is dead.
And now you are teaching <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>The feeling in the child's voice, and the humble emphasis on the pronoun
<i>me</i>, touched the old lady; something familiar too in the tone caused
her to look up quickly and kindly over her spectacles, and it seemed to
her for a moment as if the little, long-lost sister sat opposite to
her&mdash;great grey eyes, delicate skin, bright brown hair, expression of
vivid interest, and all.</p>

<p>"Strange! strange!" she muttered to herself several times.</p>

<p>"I am supposed to be like grandmamma, am I not?" said Beth, as if she
read her thoughts.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> like her," Aunt Victoria rejoined.</p>

<p>"But you can be a plain likeness of a good-looking person, I suppose?"
Beth said tentatively.</p>

<p>"Certainly you can," Miss Victoria answered with decision; and the spark
of pleasure in her own personal appearance, which had recently been
kindled in Beth, instantly flickered and went out.</p>

<p>Their little sitting-room had a bow-window down to the ground, the front
part of which formed two doors with glass in the upper part and wood
below, leading out into the garden. On fine days they always stood wide
open, and the warm summer air scented with roses streamed in. Both Beth
and Aunt Victoria loved to look out into the garden. From where Beth sat
to do her French at the end of the table, she could see the soft green
turf, a bright flower-border, and an old brick wall, mellowed in tone by
age, behind it; and a little to the left, a high, thick screen of tall
shrubs of many varieties, set so close that all the different shades of
green melted into each other. The irregular roof of a large house,
standing on lower ground than the garden, with quaint gables and old
chimneys, rose above the belt of shrubs; the tiles on it lay in layers
that made Beth think of a wasp's nest, only that they were dark-red
instead of grey; but she loved the colour as it appeared all amongst the
green trees and up against the blue sky. She often wondered what was
going on under that roof, and used to invent stories about it. She did
not write anything in these days, however, but stored up impressions
which were afterwards of inestimable value to her. The smooth grey boles
of the beeches, the green down on the larches, the dark, blue-green
crown which the Scotch fir held up, as if to accentuate the light blue
of the sky, and the wonderful

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
 ruddy-gold tones that shone on its trunk
as the day declined; these things she felt and absorbed rather than saw
and noted, but because she felt them they fired her soul, and resolved
themselves into poetic expression eventually.</p>

<p>They dined early, and on the hot afternoons they sat and worked together
after dinner, Beth sewing and Aunt Victoria knitting, until it was cool
enough to go out. Aunt Victoria was teaching Beth how to make some new
underclothing for herself, to Beth's great delight. All of her old
things that were not rags were patches, and the shame of having them so
was a continual source of discomfort to her; but Aunt Victoria, when she
discovered the state of Beth's wardrobe, bought some calico out of her
own scanty means, and set her to work. During these long afternoons,
they had many a conversation that Beth recollected with pleasure and
profit. She often amused and interested the old lady; and sometimes she
drew from her a serious reprimand or a solemn lecture, for both of which
she was much the better. Aunt Victoria was severe, but she was
sympathetic, and she was just; she seldom praised, but she showed that
she was satisfied, and that was enough for Beth; and she never scolded
or punished, only spoke seriously when she was displeased, and then Beth
was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>One very hot day when they were working together, Aunt Victoria sitting
on a high-backed chair with her back to the open doors because the light
was too much for her eyes, and Beth sitting beside her on a lower seat,
but so that she could look up at her, and also out into the garden, it
occurred to her that once on a time, long ago, Aunt Victoria must have
been young, and she tried artfully to find out first, if Aunt Victoria
remembered the fact, and secondly, what little girls were like at that
remote period.</p>

<p>"Was your mamma like mine, Aunt Victoria?" she asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria had just made a mistake in her knitting, and answered
shortly: "No, child."</p>

<p>"When you were all children," Beth pursued, "did you play together?"</p>

<p>"Not much," Aunt Victoria answered grimly.</p>

<p>"Did you quarrel?"</p>

<p>"My dear child! what could put such a notion into your head?"</p>

<p>"What did you do then?" said Beth. "You couldn't have been all the time
learning to sit upright on a high-backed chair; and I am trying so hard
to think what your home was like. I wish you would tell me."</p>

<p>"It was not at all like yours," Aunt Victoria replied with emphasis. "We
were most carefully brought up children. Our

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> mother was an admirable
person. She lived by rule. If one of her children was born at night, it
was kept in the house until the morning, and then sent out to nurse
until it was two years old. If it was born by day, it was sent away at
once."</p>

<p>"And didn't great-grandmamma ever go to see it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; twice a year."</p>

<p>"I think," said Beth, reflecting, "I should like to keep my babies at
home. I should want to put their little soft faces against mine, and
kiss them, you know."</p>

<p>"Your great-grandmamma did her duty," said Aunt Victoria with grim
approval. "She never let any of us loll as you are doing now, Beth. She
made us all sit up, as <i>I</i> always do, and as I am always telling you to
do; and the consequence was our backs grew strong and never ached."</p>

<p>"And were you happy?" Beth said solemnly.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria gazed at her vaguely. She had never asked herself the
question. Then Beth sat with her work on her lap for a little, looking
up at the summer sky. It was an exquisite deep blue just then, with
filmy white clouds drawn up over it like gauze to veil its brightness.
The red roofs and gables and chimneys of the old house below, the
shrubs, the dark Scotch fir, the copper-beech, the limes and the
chestnut stood out clearly silhouetted against it; and Beth felt the
forms and tints and tones of them all, although she was thinking of
something else.</p>

<p>"Mamma's back is always aching," she observed at last, returning to her
work.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is because she was not so well brought up as we were," Aunt
Victoria rejoined.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> says it is because she had such a lot of children," said Beth.
"Did you ever have any children, Aunt Victoria?"</p>

<p>Miss Victoria Bench let her knitting fall on her lap&mdash;"My&mdash;dear&mdash;child!"
she gasped, holding up both her hands in horror.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," said Beth. "Only married ladies have children. Servants
have them, though, sometimes before they are married, Harriet says, and
then they call them bad girls. Grandmamma wasn't as wise as
great-grandmamma, I suppose, but perhaps great-grandmamma had a good
husband. Grandpapa was an awful old rip, you know."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria stared at her aghast.</p>

<p>"He used to drink," Beth proceeded, lowering her voice, and glancing
round mysteriously as the old servants at Fairholm did when they
discussed these things; "and grandmamma couldn't bear his ways or his
language, and used to shut herself up in her own room more and more, and
they never agreed, and at last she went quite mad, so the saying came
true. Did you never hear the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
 saying? Why, you know her father's crest
was a raven, and grandpapa's crest was a bee, and for generations the
families had lived near each other and never been friends; and it was
said, if the blood of the bees and the ravens were ever put in the same
bowl it wouldn't mingle. Do you say 'if it were,' or 'if it was,' Aunt
Victoria? Mamma says 'if it were.'"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> were taught to say 'if it was,'" Aunt Victoria answered stiffly;
"but your mamma may know better."</p>

<p>Beth thought about this for a minute, then set it aside for further
inquiry, and dispassionately resumed. "That was a mean trick of Uncle
James's, but it was rather clever too; I should never have thought of
it. I mean with the fly, you know. When grandpapa died, Uncle James got
his will and altered it, so that mamma mightn't have any money; and he
put a fly in grandpapa's mouth, and swore that the will was signed by
his hand while there was life in him."</p>

<p>"My dear child," said Aunt Victoria sharply, "who told you such a
preposterous story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard it about the place," Beth answered casually; "everybody
knows it." She took another needleful of thread, and sewed on steadily
for a little, and Aunt Victoria kept glancing at her meanwhile, with a
very puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"But what I want to know is <i>why</i> did grandmamma stay with grandpapa if
he were, or was, such a very bad man?" Beth said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Because it was her duty," said Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>"And what was his duty?"</p>

<p>"I think, Beth," said the old lady, "you have done sewing enough for
this afternoon. Run out into the garden."</p>

<p>Beth knew that this was only an excuse not to answer her, but she folded
her work up obediently, observing as she did so, however, with decision,
"If <i>I</i> ever have a bad husband, I shall <i>not</i> stay with him, for I
can't see what good comes of it."</p>

<p>"Your grandmamma had her children to think of," said Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>"But what good did she do them?" Beth wanted to know. "She devoted
herself to Uncle James, but she didn't make much of a man of him! And
she had no influence whatever with mamma. Mamma was her father's
favourite, and he taught her to despise grandmamma because she couldn't
hunt, and shrieked if she saw things killed. I think that's silly
myself, but it's better than being hard. Of course mamma is worth a
dozen of Uncle James, but&mdash;" Beth shrugged her shoulders, then added
temperately, "You know mamma has her faults, Aunt Victoria, it's no use
denying it. So what good did grandmamma do by staying? She just went mad
and died! If she'd gone

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
 away, and lived as you do, she might have been
alive and well now."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear child," said the old lady sorrowfully, "that never could
have been; for I have observed that no woman who marries and becomes a
mother can ever again live happily like a single woman. She has entered
upon a different phase of being, and there is no return for her. There
is a weight of meaning in that expression: 'the ties of home.' It is
'the ties of home' that restrain a loving woman, however much she
suffers; there are the little daily duties that no one but herself can
see to; and there is always some one who would be worse off if she went.
There is habit too; and there are those small possessions, each one with
an association of its own perhaps, that makes it almost a sacred thing;
but above all, there is hope&mdash;the hope that matters may mend; and
fear&mdash;the fear that once she deserts her post things will go from bad to
worse, and she be to blame. In your grandmamma's day such a thing would
never have been thought of by a good woman; and even now, when there are
women who actually go away and work for themselves, if their homes are
unhappy&mdash;" Aunt Victoria pursed up her lips, and shook her head. "It may
be respectable, of course," she concluded magnanimously; "but I cannot
believe it is either right or wise, and certainly it is not loyal."</p>

<p>"Loyal!" Beth echoed; "that was my father's word to me: 'Be loyal.'
We've got to be loyal to others; but he also said that we must be loyal
to ourselves."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria had folded up her knitting, and now rose stiffly, and went
out into the garden with an old parasol, and sat meditating in the sun
on the trunk of a tree that had been cut down. She often sat so under
her parasol, and Beth used to watch her, and wonder what it felt like to
be able to look such a long, long way back, and have so many things to
remember.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Victoria</span> was surprised herself to find how kindly Beth took to a
regular life, how exact she was in the performance of her little
housekeeping duties, and how punctual in everything; she had never
suspected that Beth's whole leaning was towards law and order, nor
observed that even in her most lawless ways there was a certain system;
that she fished, and poached, and prowled, fought Bernadine, and helped
Harriet, as regularly as she dined, and went to bed. Habits, good or
bad, may be formed in an incredibly short time if they are congenial;
the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
 saints by nature will pray, and the sinners sin, as soon as the
example is set them; and Beth, accordingly, fell into Aunt Victoria's
dainty fastidious ways, which were the ways of a gentlewoman, at once
and without effort; and ever afterwards was only happy in her domestic
life when she could live by the same rule in an atmosphere of equal
refinement&mdash;an honest atmosphere where everything was done thoroughly,
and every word spoken was perfectly sincere. Of course she relapsed many
times&mdash;it was her nature to experiment, to wander before she settled, to
see for herself; but it was by intimacy with lower natures that she
learned fully to appreciate the higher; by the effect of bad books upon
her that she learned the value of good ones; by the lowering of her
whole tone which came of countenancing laxity in others, and by the
discomfort and degradation which follow on disorder, that she was
eventually confirmed in her principles. The taste for the higher life,
once implanted, is not to be eradicated; and those who have been
uplifted by the glory of it once will strive to attain to it again,
inevitably.</p>

<p>It was through the influence of this time that the most charming traits
in Beth's character were finally developed&mdash;traits which, but for the
tender discipline of the dear old aunt, might have remained latent for
ever.</p>

<p>It would be misleading, however, to let it be supposed that Beth's
conduct was altogether satisfactory during this visit. On the contrary,
she gave Miss Victoria many an anxious moment; for although she did all
that the old lady required of her, she did many other things besides,
things required of her by her own temperament only. She had to climb the
great tree at the end of the lawn, for instance, in order to peep into
the nest near the top, and also to see into the demesne beyond the belt
of shrubs, where the red-roofed house stood, peopled now by friends of
her fancy. This would not have been so bad if she had come down safely;
but a branch broke, and she fell and hurt herself, which alarmed Miss
Victoria very much. Then Miss Victoria used to send her on errands to
develop her intelligence; but Beth invariably lost herself at first; if
she only had to turn the corner, she could not find her way back. Aunt
Victoria tried to teach her to note little landmarks in her own mind as
she went along, such as the red pillar-box at the corner of the street
where she was to turn, and the green shutters on the house where she was
to cross; and Beth noticed these and many more things carefully as she
went, and could describe their position accurately afterwards; but, by
the time she turned, the vision and the dream would be upon her as a
rule, and she would walk in a world of fancy, utterly oblivious of red
pillar-boxes, green shutters, or anything else on earth, until she was
brought up wondering by a lamp-post,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
 tree, or some unoffending person
with whom she had collided in her abstraction; then she would have to
ask her way; but she was slow to find it by direction; and all the time
she was wandering about, Aunt Victoria would be worrying herself with
fears for her safety until she was quite upset.</p>

<p>Beth was rebellious, too, about some things. There was a grocery shop at
one end of the street, kept by a respectable woman, but Beth refused to
go to it because the respectable woman had a fussy little Pomeranian
dog, and allowed it to lick her hands and face all over, which so
disgusted Beth that she could not eat anything the woman touched. It was
in this shop that Beth picked up the moribund black beetle that kicked
out suddenly, and set up the horror of crawling things from which she
ever afterwards suffered. This was another reason for not going back to
the shop, but Aunt Victoria could not understand it, and insisted on
sending her. Beth was firmly naughty in the matter, however, and would
not go, greatly to the old lady's discomposure.</p>

<p>One means of torture, unconsciously devised by Aunt Victoria, tried Beth
extremely. Aunt Victoria used to send her to church alone on Sunday
afternoons to hear a certain eloquent preacher, and required her to
repeat the text, and tell her what the whole sermon was about on her
return. Beth did her best, but if she managed to remember the text by
repeating it all the time, she could not attend to the sermon, and if
she attended to the sermon, she invariably forgot the text. It was
another instance of the trickishness of her memory; she could have
remembered both the text and sermon without an effort had she not been
afraid of forgetting them.</p>

<p>But the thing that gave her aunt most trouble of mind was Beth's habit
of making acquaintance with all kinds of people. It was vain to warn
her, and worse than vain, for the reasons Aunt Victoria gave her for not
knowing people only excited her interest in them, and she would wait
about, watching, to see for herself, studying their habits with the
patient pertinacity of a naturalist. The drawing-room floor was let to a
lady whose husband was at sea, a Mrs. Crome. She was very intimate with
a gentleman who also lodged in the house, a friend of her husband's, she
said, who had promised to look after her during his absence. Their
bedrooms adjoined, and Beth used to see their boots outside their doors
every morning when she went down to breakfast, and wonder why they got
up so late.</p>

<p>"Out again together nearly all last night," Prentice remarked to Aunt
Victoria one morning; and then they shook their heads, but agreed that
there was nothing to be done. From this and other remarks, however, Beth
gathered that Mrs. Crome was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
 going to perdition; and from that time she
had a horrid fascination for Beth, who would gaze at her whenever she
had an opportunity, with great solemn eyes dilated, as if she were
learning her by heart&mdash;as, indeed, she was&mdash;involuntarily, for future
reference; for Mrs. Crome was one of a pronounced type, as Beth learnt
eventually, when she knew the world better, an example which helped her
to recognise other specimens of the kind whenever she met them.</p>

<p>She scraped acquaintance with Mrs. Crome on the stairs, at last, and was
surprised to find her as kind as could be, and was inclined to argue
from this that Prentice and Aunt Victoria must be mistaken about her.
But one evening Mrs. Crome tempted her into the drawing-room. The
gentleman was there, smoking a cigar and drinking whisky-and-water; and
there was something in the whole aspect and atmosphere of the room that
made Beth feel exceedingly uncomfortable, and wish she was out of it
immediately.</p>

<p>"Aren't you very dull with that old lady?" said Mrs. Crome. "I suppose
she never takes you to the theatre or anything."</p>

<p>"No," said Beth; "she does not approve of theatres."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose she doesn't approve of me?" Mrs. Crome observed
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"No," said Beth solemnly; "she does not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Crome burst out laughing, and so did the gentleman.</p>

<p>"This is rich, really," he said. "What a quaint little person!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but she's sweet!" said Mrs. Crome; and then she kissed Beth, and
Beth noticed that she had been eating onions, and for long afterwards
she associated the smell with theatres, frivolous talk, and a
fair-haired woman smiling fatuously on the brink of perdition.</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria retired early to perform her evening ablutions, and on
this occasion she had gone up just as usual, with a little bell, which
she rang when she was ready for Beth to come. In the midst of the talk
and laughter in the drawing-room the little bell suddenly sounded
emphatically, and Beth fled. She found Aunt Victoria out on the landing
in her petticoat and dressing-jacket, and without her auburn front, a
sign of great perturbation. She had heard Beth's voice in the
drawing-room, and proceeded to admonish her severely. But Beth heard not
a word; for the sight of the old lady's stubbly white hair had plunged
her into a reverie, and already, when the vision and the dream were upon
her, no Indian devotee, absorbed in contemplation, could be less
sensitive to outward impressions than Beth was. Aunt Victoria had to
shake her to rouse her.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, child?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Riding to the rescue," Beth answered dreamily.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense," said Aunt Victoria. Beth gazed at her with a
blank look. She was saving souls just then, and could attend to nothing
else.</p>

<p>Beth's terror of the Judgment never returned; but after she had been
away from home a few weeks she began to have another serious trouble
which disturbed her towards evening in the same way. The first symptom
was a curious lapse of memory which worried her a good deal. She could
not remember how much of the garden was to be seen from her mother's
bedroom window at home, and she longed to fly back and settle the
question. Then she became conscious of being surrounded by the country
on every side, and it oppressed her to think of it. She was a sea-child,
living inland for the first time, and there came upon her a great
yearning for the sight and sound of moving waters. She sniffed the
land-breeze, and found it sweet but insipid in her nostrils after the
tonic freshness of the sea-air. She heard the voice of her beloved in
the sough of the wind among the trees, and it made her inexpressibly
melancholy. Her energy began to ebb. She did not care to move about
much, but would sit silently sewing by the hour together, outwardly
calm, inwardly all an ache to go back to the sea. She used to wonder
whether the tide was coming in or going out; wonder if the fish were
biting, how the sands looked, and who was on the pier. She devoured
every scrap of news that came from home in the hope of finding something
to satisfy her longing. Bernadine wrote her an elaborate letter in large
hand, which Beth thought very wonderful; Harriet sent her a letter also,
chiefly composed of moral sentiments copied from the <i>Family Herald</i>,
with a view to producing a favourable impression on Miss Victoria; and
Mrs. Caldwell wrote regularly once a week, a formal duty-letter, but a
joy to Beth, to whom letters of any kind were a new and surprising
experience. She had never expected that any one would write to her; and
in the first flush of her gratitude she responded with enthusiasm,
sending her mother, in particular, long descriptions of her life and
surroundings, which Mrs. Caldwell thought so good she showed them to
everybody. In replying to Beth, however, she expressed no approval or
pleasure; on the contrary, she put Beth to shame by the way she dwelt on
her mistakes in spelling, which effectually checked the outpourings, and
shut Beth up in herself again, so that she mourned the more. During the
day she kept up pretty well, but towards twilight, always her time of
trial, the yearning for home, for mamma, for Harriet, for Bernadine,
began again; the most gloomy fears of what might be happening to them in
her absence possessed her, and she had great difficulty in keeping back
her tears. Aunt Victoria noticed her depression, but mistook it for
fatigue, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
 sent her to bed early, which Beth was glad of, because she
wanted to be alone and cry. But one evening, when she was looking
particularly sad, the old lady asked if she did not feel well.</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel quite well, thank you, Aunt Victoria," Beth answered with a
great sigh; "but I know now what you meant about home-ties. They do pull
strong."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Aunt Victoria, enlightened; "you are homesick, are you?"</p>

<p>And from that day forward, when she saw Beth moping, she took her out of
herself by making her discuss the subject, and so relieved her; but Beth
continued to suffer, although less acutely, until her return.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Rainharbour</span> was not yet deserted by summer visitors, although it was
late in the autumn when Beth and Aunt Victoria returned. It had been
such a lovely season that the holiday people lingered, loath to leave
the freshness of the sea and the freedom of the shore for the stuffy
indoor duties and the conventional restrictions of their town lives.</p>

<p>On the day of their arrival, Beth looked about her in amaze. She had
experienced such a world of change in herself since she went away, that
she was surprised to find the streets unaltered; and yet, although they
were unaltered, they did not look the same. It was as if the focus of
her eyes had been readjusted so as to make familiar objects seem
strange, and change the perspective of everything; which gave the place
a different air, a look of having been swept and garnished and set in
order like a toy-town. But the people they passed were altogether
unchanged, and this seemed stranger still to Beth. There they had been
all the time, walking about as usual, wearing the same clothes, thinking
the same thoughts; they had had no new experiences, and, what was worse,
they were not only unconscious of any that she might have had, but were
profoundly indifferent; and to Beth, on the threshold of life, all eager
interest in everything, caring greatly to know, and ready to sympathise,
this vision of the self-centred with shrivelled hearts was terrible; it
gave her the sensation of being the one living thing that could feel in
a world of automata moved by machinery.</p>

<p>Bernadine and her mother had met them at the station, but Beth was so
busy looking about her, collecting impressions, she had hardly a word to
say to either of them. Mrs. Caldwell set this down as another sign of
want of proper affection, but Aunt Victoria grumped that it was nothing
but natural excitement.</p>

<p>The first thing Beth did after greeting Harriet, who stood

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> smiling at
the door, was to run upstairs to her mother's bedroom to settle the
question of how much of the garden was visible from the window; and then
she rushed on up to the attic, dragged a big box under the skylight in
hot haste, and climbed up on it to look at the sea. It was the one
glimpse of it to be had from the house, just a corner, where the water
washed up against the white cliffs that curved round an angle of the
bay. Beth flung the skylight open, and gazed, then drew in her breath
with a great sigh of satisfaction. The sea! The sea! Even that glimpse
of it was refreshing as a long cool drink to one exhausted by heat and
cruelly athirst.</p>

<p>While she was away, Beth had made many good resolutions about behaving
herself on her return. Aunt Victoria had talked to her seriously on the
subject. Beth could be good enough when she liked: she did all that her
aunt expected of her; why could she not do all that her mother expected?
Beth promised she would; and was beginning already to keep her promise
faithfully by being as troublesome as possible, which was all that her
mother ever expected of her. Whether or not thoughts are things which
have power to produce effects, there are certainly people who answer to
expectation with fatal facility, and Beth was one of them. Eventually
she resisted with all her own individuality, but at this time she acted
like an instrument played upon by other people's minds. This peculiar
sensitiveness she turned to account in after life, using it as a key to
character; she had merely to make herself passive, when she found
herself reflecting the people with whom she conversed involuntarily; and
not as they appeared on the surface, but as they actually were in their
inmost selves. In her childhood she unconsciously illustrated the
thoughts people had in their minds about her. Aunt Victoria believed in
her and trusted her, and when they were alone together, Beth responded
to her good opinion; Mrs. Caldwell expected her to be nothing but a
worry, and was not disappointed. When Beth was in the same house with
both aunt and mother, she varied, answering to the expectation that
happened to be strongest at the moment. That afternoon Aunt Victoria was
tired after her journey, and did not think of Beth at all; but Mrs.
Caldwell was busy in her own mind anticipating all the trouble she would
have now Beth was back; and Beth, standing on the box under the attic
skylight, with her head out, straining her eyes to seaward, was seized
with a sudden impulse which answered to her mother's expectation. That
first day she ought to have stayed in, unpacked her box, exhibited her
beautiful needlework, got ready for dinner in good time, and proved her
affection for her mother and sister by making herself agreeable to them;
but instead of that, she stole downstairs, slipped out by the back-gate,
and did not return until long after dinner was over.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not enjoy the scamper, however. Her home-sickness was gone, but
her depression returned nevertheless, as the day declined, only in
another form. She had still that curious sensation of being the only
living thing in a world of figures moved by mechanism. She stood at the
top of the steps which led down on to the pier, where the sailors
loitered at idle times, and was greeted by those she knew with slow
smiles of recognition; but she had nothing to say to any of them.</p>

<p>The tide was going out, and had left some of the ships in the harbour
all canted to one side; cobles and pleasure-boats rested in the mud; a
cockle-gatherer was wading about in it with his trousers turned up over
his knees, and his bare legs so thickly coated, it looked as if he had
black leggings on. Beth went to the edge of the pier, and stood for a
few minutes looking down at him. She was facing west, but the sun was
already too low to hurt her eyes. On her right the red-roofed houses
crowded down to the quay irregularly. Fishing-nets were hanging out of
some of the windows. Here and there, down in the harbour, the rich brown
sails had been hoisted on some of the cobles to dry. There were some
yachts at anchor, and Beth looked at them eagerly, hoping to find Count
Bartahlinsky's <i>Seagull</i> amongst them. It was not there; but presently
she became conscious of some one standing beside her, and on looking up
she recognised Black Gard, the Count's confidential man. He was dressed
like the fishermen in drab trousers and a dark blue jersey, but wore a
blue cloth cap, with the name of the yacht on it, instead of a
sou'wester.</p>

<p>"Has your master returned?" she said.</p>

<p>"No, miss," he answered. "He's still abroad. He'll be back for the
hunting, though."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Beth, resentful of that vague "abroad," which
absorbed him into itself the greater part of the year. When she had
spoken, she turned her back on Gard and the sunset, and wandered off up
the cliffs. She had noticed a sickly smell coming up from the mud in the
harbour, and wanted to escape from it, but somehow it seemed to
accompany her. It reminded her of something&mdash;no, that was not it. What
she was searching about in her mind for was some way, not to name it,
but to express it. She felt there was a formula for it within reach, but
for some time she could not recover it. Then she gave up the attempt,
and immediately afterwards she suddenly said to herself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"... the smell of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came reeking from those spicy bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man, the sacrifice of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled his taint with every breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upwafted from the innocent flowers."<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></div></div>

<p>She did not search for any occult meaning in the lines, nor did they
convey anything special to her; but they remained with her for the rest
of the day, haunting her, in among her other thoughts, and forcing
themselves upon her attention with the irritating persistency of a
catchy tune.</p>

<p>On the cliffs she paused to look about her. It was a desolate scene. The
tide was so far out by this time it looked as if there were more sand
than sea in the bay. The water was the cloudy grey colour of flint, with
white rims where the waves broke on the shore. The sky was low, level,
and dark; where it met the water there was a heavy bank of cloud, from
which an occasional flash of summer lightning, dimmed by daylight, shot
along the horizon. The air was peculiarly clear, so that distant objects
seemed nearer than was natural. The sheltering headland on the left,
which formed the bay, stood out bright white with a crown of vivid green
against the sombre sea and sky; while, on the right, the old grey pier,
which shut in the view in that direction, and the red-roofed houses of
the town crowding down to it, showed details of design and masonry not
generally visible to the naked eye from where Beth stood. There were
neither ships nor boats in the bay; but a few cobles, with their
red-brown sails flapping limp against their masts, rocked lazily at the
harbour-mouth waiting for the tide to rise and float them in. Beth heard
the men on them shouting an occasional remark to one another, and now
and then one of them would sing an uncouth snatch of song, but the
effort was spiritless, and did not last.</p>

<p>Leaving the harbour behind, Beth walked on towards the headland.
Presently she noticed in front of her the dignified and pathetic figure
of an old man, a Roman Catholic priest, Canon Hunter, who, sacrificing
all worldly ease or chance of advancement, had come to minister to the
neglected fisherfolk on the coast, most of whom were Roman Catholics. He
led the life of a saint amongst them, living in dire poverty, his
congregation being all of the poorest, with the exception of one lady in
the neighbourhood, married to a man whose vices were too expensive to
leave him much to spare for his wife's charities. She managed, however,
to raise enough money for the rent of the top room in the public hall,
which they used as a chapel, and so kept the flickering flame of the old
religion alight in the place; but it was a severe struggle. It was
whispered, indeed, that more of the gentry in the neighbourhood
sympathised with the Catholics than was supposed, and would have helped
them but for the discredit&mdash;did help them, in fact, when they dared; but
no one outside the communion knew how true this report might be, and the
fisherfolk loyally held their peace.</p>

<p>It was natural that Beth as she grew up should be attracted

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> by the
mystery that surrounded the Roman Catholics, and anxious to comprehend
the horror that Protestants had of them. She knew more of them herself
than any of the people whom she heard pass uncharitable strictures upon
them, and knew nothing for which they could justly be blamed. For the
old priest himself she had a great reverence. She had never spoken to
him, but had always felt strongly drawn towards him; and now, when she
overtook him, her impulse was to slip her hand into his, less on her own
account, however, than to show sympathy with him, he seemed so solitary
and so suffering, with his slow step and bent back; and so good, with
his beautiful calm face.</p>

<p>As she approached, lost in her own thoughts, she gazed up at him
intently.</p>

<p>"What is it, my child?" he asked, with a kindly smile. "Can I do
anything for you?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the beauty of holiness," Beth answered, and passed
on.</p>

<p>The old man looked after her, too surprised for the moment to speak, and
by the time he had recovered himself, she had turned a corner and was
out of sight.</p>

<p>After Beth went home that evening, and had been duly reproached by her
mother for her selfish conduct, she stole upstairs to Aunt Victoria's
room, and found the old lady sitting with her big Bible on her knee,
looking very sad and serious.</p>

<p>"Beth," she said severely, "have you had any food? It is long past your
dinner-time, and it does not do for young girls to fast too long."</p>

<p>"I'll go and get something to eat, Aunt Victoria," Beth answered meekly,
overcome by her kindness. "I forgot."</p>

<p>She went down to the pantry, and found some cold pie, which she took
into the kitchen and ate without appetite.</p>

<p>The heat was oppressive. All the doors and windows stood wide open, but
there was no air, and wherever Beth went she was haunted by the sickly
smell which she had first perceived coming up from the mud in the
harbour, and by the lines which seemed somehow to account for it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"... the smell of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came reeking from those spicy bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man, the sacrifice of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingled his taint with every breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upwafted from the innocent flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she had eaten all she could, she went back to Aunt Victoria.</p>

<p>"Shall we read the psalms?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," the old lady answered. "I have been waiting for you a long
time, Beth."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria, I am very sorry," Beth protested. "I didn't think."</p>

<p>"Ah, Beth," the old lady said sorrowfully, "how often is that to be your
excuse? You are always thinking, but it is only your own wild fancies
that occupy you. When will you learn to think of others?"</p>

<p>"I try always," Beth answered sincerely; "but what am I to do when 'wild
fancies' come crowding in spite of me, and all I ought to remember slips
away?"</p>

<p>"Pray," Aunt Victoria answered austerely. "Prayer shapes a life; and
those lives are the most beautiful which have been shaped by prayer.
Prayer is creative; it transposes intention into action, and makes it
inevitable for us to be and to do more than would be possible by any
other means."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and then Miss Victoria began the psalm. It
was a joy to Beth to hear her read, she read so beautifully; and it was
from her that Beth herself acquired the accomplishment, for which she
was afterwards noted. Verse by verse they read the psalms together as a
rule, and Beth was usually attentive; but that evening, before the end,
her attention became distracted by a loud ticking; and the last word was
scarcely pronounced before she exclaimed, looking about her&mdash;"Aunt
Victoria, what is that ticking? I see no clock."</p>

<p>The old lady looked up calmly, but she was very pale. "You do hear it
then?" she replied. "It has been going on all day."</p>

<p>Beth's heart stood still an instant, and, in spite of the heat, her skin
crisped as if the surface of her body had been suddenly sprayed with
cold water. "The Death Watch!" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>The ticking stopped a moment as if in answer to the words, and then
began again. A horrible foreboding seized upon Beth.</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no, not that!" she exclaimed, shuddering; and then, all at
once, she threw herself upon her knees beside Aunt Victoria, clasped her
arms round her, and burst into a tempest of tears and sobs.</p>

<p>"Beth, Beth, my dear child," the old lady cried in dismay, "control
yourself. It is only a little insect in the wood. It may mean nothing."</p>

<p>"It does mean something," Beth interrupted vehemently; "I know&mdash;I always
know. The smell of death has been about me all the afternoon, but I did
not understand, although the words were in my mouth. When things mean
nothing, they don't make you feel queer&mdash;they don't impress you. Nine
times running you may see a solitary crow, or spill the salt, or sit
down thirteen to table, and laugh at all superstitious nonsense; then
the sign was not for you; but the tenth time, something will come over
you, and you won't laugh; then be warned and beware! I sometimes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> feel
as if I were listening, but not with my ears, and waiting for things to
happen that I know about, but not with my head; and I try always to
understand when I find myself listening, but not with my ears, and
something surely comes; and so also when I am waiting for things to
happen that I know about, but not with my head; they do happen. Only
most of the time I know that something is coming, but I cannot tell what
it is. In order to be able to tell exactly, I have to hold myself in a
certain attitude&mdash;not my body, you know, <i>myself</i>&mdash;hold myself in
suspense, as it were, or suspend something in myself, stop something,
push something aside&mdash;I can't get it into words; I can't always do it;
but when I can, then I know."</p>

<p>"Who taught you this?" Aunt Victoria asked, as if she were startled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no one taught me," Beth answered. "I just found myself doing it.
Then I tried to notice how it was done. I wanted to be able to do it
myself when I liked. And it was just as if there were two doors, and one
had to be shut before I could look out of the other&mdash;the one that is my
nose and eyes and ears; when that is shut, then I know; I look out of
the other. Do things come to you so, Aunt Victoria?"</p>

<p>The old lady had taken Beth's hand, and was stroking it and looking at
her very seriously. "No," she said, shaking her head, "no, things do not
come to me like that. But although I have only one set of faculties
myself, my outlook is not so limited by them that I cannot comprehend
the possibility of something beyond. There are written records of people
in olden times who must have possessed some such power&mdash;some further
faculty such as you describe. It may be that it lies latent in the whole
race, awaiting favourable conditions to develop itself, and some few
rare beings have come into possession of it already. We are complex
creatures&mdash;body, soul, and spirit, says the saint; and there is
spiritual power. Beth, lay hold of that which you perceive in yourself,
cherish it, cultivate it, live the life necessary to develop it; for be
sure it is a great gift&mdash;it may be a divine one."</p>

<p>When the old lady stopped, Beth raised her head and looked about her, as
if she had just awakened from sleep. "What were we talking about before
that?" she said. "Oh, I know&mdash;the Death Watch. It has stopped."</p>

<p>The equinoctial gales set in early that year, and severely. Great seas
washed away the silver sands which had been the delight of the summer
visitors, leaving miles of clay exposed at low water to add to the
desolation of the scene. The bay was full of storm-stayed vessels, all
headed to the wind, close reefed, and straining at their anchors. There
were days when the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
 steamers had to steam full speed ahead in order to
keep at their berths; and then the big sailing ships would drag their
anchors and come drifting, drifting helplessly towards the shore, and
have to fly before the gale if they could, or take their chance of
stranding if the water were low, or being battered to bits against the
cliffs if the tide were in. Many a time Beth stood among the fishermen
watching, waiting, praying; her whole being centred on some hapless
crew, making for the harbour, but almost certain to be carried past.
There was a chain down the middle of the pier in the winter to prevent
people from being washed off, and she had stood clinging to this, and
seen a great ship, with one ragged sail fluttering from a broken mast,
carried before the wind right on to the pier-head, which it struck with
a crash that displaced great blocks of granite as if they had been
sponge-cakes; and when it struck, the doomed sailors on its decks sent
up an awful shriek, to which those on the pier responded. Then there was
a pause. Beth held her breath and heard nothing; but she saw the ship
slip back, back&mdash;down amongst the mountainous waves, which sported with
it once or twice, tossed it up, and sucked it down, tossed it again,
then suddenly engulfed it. On the water afterwards there were ropes and
spars, and dark things bobbing like corks, but she knew they were men in
mortal agony; and she found herself shouting encouragement, telling them
to hold on bravely, help was coming&mdash;the lifeboat! the lifeboat! She
joined in the sob of excitement too, and the cheers of relief when it
returned with its crew complete, and five poor wretches rescued&mdash;only
five out of fifteen, but still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blessed be God," said the old priest, "for those whom He has received
into glory; and blessed be His holy name for those whom He deigns to let
live."</p>

<p>Beth, standing beside him, heard the words, and wonderingly contrasted
him with Parson Richardson, who remained shut up with his fourth wife in
his fat living, making cent. per cent. out of his school, and heedless
of the parish, while one so old and feeble as Canon Hunter stood by his
people at all times, careless of himself, enduring hardship, braving
danger, a man among men in spite of age and weakness, by reason of great
love.</p>

<p>The pinch of poverty was severely felt again that winter in the Caldwell
household. Beth, who was growing rapidly, became torpid from excessive
self-denial; she tried to do without enough, to make it as if there were
one mouth less to feed, and the privation told upon her; her energy
flagged; when she went out, she found it difficult to drag herself home,
and the exuberant spirit of daring, which found expression in naughty
enterprises, suddenly subsided. She poached on principle still for the
benefit of the family; but the cool confidence born of a sort of inward

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
certainty, which is a premonition of success, if it is not the power
that compels it, was wanting; and it was as if her own doubts when she
set the snares released the creatures from the fascination that should
have lured them, so that she caught but little. The weather, too, was
very severe; every one in the house, including Beth, was more or less
ill from colds and coughs, and Aunt Victoria suffered especially; but
none of them complained, not even to themselves; they just endured. They
felt for each other, however.</p>

<p>"Mamma, don't you think Aunt Victoria should have a fire in her room?"
Beth said one day.</p>

<p>"I do, my dear child," Mrs. Caldwell answered tartly; "but <i>I</i> can't
afford the fuel, and she can't afford it either."</p>

<p>"I wish I had known that," said Beth. "I wouldn't have let her afford to
take me away in the summer, spending all her money for nothing."</p>

<p>"What a grateful and gracious child you are!" her mother exclaimed.</p>

<p>Beth went frowning from the room.</p>

<p>The snow was several feet deep on the ground already, and was still
falling heavily. Beth put on her things and stole out, her idea being to
gather sticks to make a fire for the old lady; but after a weary trudge
she was obliged to return empty-handed, wet, weary, and disheartened.
The sticks were deep down under the snow; there were none to be seen.</p>

<p>"O God!" Beth prayed as she stumbled home, raising her pinched face to
the sombre sky, "O God, save Aunt Victoria all suffering. Don't let her
feel the cold, dear Lord, don't let her feel it."</p>

<p>Aunt Victoria herself was stoical. She came down to breakfast every
morning, and sat up stiffly at the end of the table away from the fire,
her usual seat, eating little, and saying little, but listening with
interest when the others spoke. Beth watched her, waited on her, and lay
awake at night fretting because there was nothing more to be done for
her.</p>

<p>One stormy night in particular, Beth could not sleep. There was a great
gale blowing. It came in terrific gusts that shook the house, rattled
the windows, and made the woodwork creak; then died away, and was
followed by an interval of comparative quiet, broken by strange,
mysterious sounds, to which Beth listened with strained attention,
unable to account for them. One moment it was as if trailing garments
swept down the narrow stairs, heavy woollen garments that made a soft
sort of muffled sound, but there was no footfall, as of some one
walking. Then there came stifled voices, whisperings, as of people
talking eagerly yet

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
cautiously. Then there were heavy steps, distinct
yet slow, followed, after an interval, by the tramp of shuffling feet,
like those of people carrying an awkward burden, and stumbling under it.
But always, before Beth could think what the noise meant, the gust came
again, racking her nerves, rattling the windows, making the doors creak;
then dying away, to be followed by more mysterious sounds, but of
another character.</p>

<p>"If only there were time&mdash;if only they would last long enough, I should
know&mdash;I should understand," Beth thought, full of foreboding. She was
not frightened, only greatly excited. Something was coming, something
was going to happen, and these were the warnings, of that she was
certain. It was as if she were sensitive to some atmosphere that
surrounds an event and becomes perceptible to those whom it concerns if
they are of the right temperament to receive the impression.</p>

<p>When the blast struck the house, blotting out the strange sounds which
puzzled Beth, it released her strained attention, and had the effect of
silence upon her after noise. In one of these pauses, she wondered if
her mother and Bernadine, in the next bed, were asleep.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said softly, "mamma!" There was no response. The gale
dropped. Then Beth heard some one coughing hard.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said again, "mamma!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mrs. Caldwell answered, awaking with a start.</p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria is coughing."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear child, I'm very sorry, but I can't help it; and it is
hardly enough to wake me for," Mrs. Caldwell answered. She settled
herself to sleep again, and the gale raged without; but Beth remained,
resting on her elbow, not listening so much as straining her attention
out into the darkness in an effort to perceive with her further faculty
what was beyond the range of her limited senses.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" she exclaimed once more, "Aunt Victoria is moaning."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Beth," Mrs. Caldwell rejoined. "You couldn't possibly hear
her if she were."</p>

<p>There was another little interval, then Beth jumped out of bed, crying
as she did so, "Mamma, Aunt Victoria is calling me."</p>

<p>"Beth," Mrs. Caldwell said, rousing herself, and speaking sternly, "get
into bed again directly, and lie down and go to sleep. It is the gale
that is making you so nervous. Put the bed-clothes over your head, and
then you won't hear it."</p>

<p>Beth had been huddling on the first thing she laid hold of in the dark,
a thick woollen dressing-gown of her mother's, while she was speaking.
"I shall go and see for myself," she replied.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said Mrs. Caldwell. "It wouldn't be you if you didn't
upset the whole house for your fancies. When you have awakened your
aunt, and spoilt her night for nothing, as you have spoilt mine, you'll
be satisfied."</p>

<p>Beth opened the door, and stepped down into darkness, unrelieved by the
slightest glimmer of light. She had to descend some steps and go up some
others to get to Aunt Victoria's room; and, after the first step, she
felt as if she were floating in some new element, not moving of her own
accord, but borne along confidently, without seeing and without feeling
her way; and, as she went, she found that the long thick garment she
wore was making the same soft muffled sound she had already heard, and
also that there was no footstep audible.</p>

<p>She went into Aunt Victoria's room without knocking. It struck Beth as
being intensely cold. A candle was burning on the little table beside
the bed. The old lady was sitting, propped up uncomfortably with two
thin pillows and a hassock. She was breathing with difficulty, and
showed no surprise when she saw Beth enter. Her lips were moving, and
Beth could see she was mumbling something, but she could distinguish no
word until she went quite close, when she heard her say, "Comfort ye,
comfort ye My people," several times.</p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria, are you ill?" Beth said. The old lady looked at her with
dim eyes, then stretched out her hand to her. Beth clasped it. It was
deadly cold.</p>

<p>"I shall light the fire," Beth said with determination, "and I shall
make you some tea to ease your cough. You won't mind if I take the
candle a moment to go downstairs and get the things?"</p>

<p>Beth was practical enough now. The vision and the dream had passed, and
she was wide awake again, using her eyes, and requiring a candle. Before
she went downstairs she fetched extra pillows from the spare room, and
propped Aunt Victoria up more comfortably. Then she set to work to light
the fire, and soon had the kettle boiling. As the room began to warm,
Aunt Victoria revived a little, and smiled on Beth for the first time
with perfect recognition. Beth had made her some tea, and was giving it
to her in spoonfuls.</p>

<p>"Is that nice?" she said.</p>

<p>"Delicious," the old lady answered.</p>

<p>The gale was all on the other side of the house, so that here in front
it was comparatively quiet; besides, the wind was dying away as the day
approached. Beth put the teacup down when Aunt Victoria had taken the
little she could, and sat on the side of the bed, holding the old lady's
hand, and gazing at her intently; and, as she watched, she saw a strange
change come

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
 over her. The darkness was fading from the sky and the
light from Aunt Victoria's face. Beth had seen nothing like this before,
and yet she had no doubt of what was coming. She had known it for days
and days; she seemed to have known it always.</p>

<p>"Shall I go for mamma?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>The old lady shook her head.</p>

<p>Beth felt strangely benumbed. She thought of rousing Harriet to fetch
the doctor, but she could not move. All feeling was suspended except the
sensation of waiting. This lasted awhile, then a lump began to mount in
her throat, and she had to gulp it down several times.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl," Aunt Victoria muttered, looking at her in her kindly
way. Beth melted. "Oh, what shall I do?" she whimpered, "you have been
so very good to me. You've taught me all the good I know, and I have
done nothing for you&mdash;nothing but bother you. But I love you, Aunt
Victoria; stay, do stay. I want to do everything you would like."</p>

<p>The old lady faintly pressed her hand, then made a last great effort to
speak. "Bless you, Beth, my dear child," she managed to say with great
difficulty. "Be comforted; you have helped me more than you know. In my
sore need, I was not left comfortless. Neither will you be. May the Lord
bless you, and keep you always. Amen."</p>

<p>Her head sank upon her breast. She seemed to settle down in the bed as
if her weight had suddenly grown greater.</p>

<p>The sombre dawn had broken by this time, and by its light Beth saw the
shadow of death come creeping over the delicate patient face.</p>

<p>"Aunt Victoria," she gasped breathlessly, like one in haste to deliver a
message before it is too late, "shall I say '<i>Lift up your heads, O ye
gates?</i>' That was the first thing you taught me."</p>

<p>The old lady spoke no more, but Beth saw that she understood. The faint
flicker of a smile, a pleased expression, came into her face and settled
there. Beth, feeling the full solemnity of the moment, got down from the
bed, and stood beside it, holding fast still to the kind old hand that
would nevermore caress or help her, as if she could keep the dear one
near her by clinging to her.</p>

<p>"<i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His
holy place?</i>" she began, with a strange vibration in her voice. "<i>He
that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul
to vanity; nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the
Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. Lift up your
heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, and the
King of glory

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
 shall come in.</i>" Beth's voice broke here, but with a
great effort she began again fervently: "<i>Lift up your heads, O ye
gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors&mdash;&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>There she stopped, for at the words the dear good kind old lady, with a
gentle sigh, as of relief, passed from the scene of her sufferings, out
of this interval of time, into the measureless eternity.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Victoria Bench</span> died of failure of the heart, the medical man
decided; and, he might have added, if the feelings of the family had not
had to be considered, that the disease was accelerated by privation and
cold.</p>

<p>For days after the event, Beth was not to be roused. She would sit in
the tenantless room by the hour together, with the dear old aunt's great
Bible on her knee open at some favourite passage, thinking of all that
ought to have been done to save her, and suffering the ache and rage of
the helpless who would certainly have done all that could have been done
had they had their way. Again and again her mother fetched her down to
the dining-room where there was a fire, and tried to reason with her, or
scolded her for her persistent grief when reasoning produced no effect.</p>

<p>"You must begin your lessons again, Beth," she said to her at last one
morning in despair. "Giving you a holiday is doing you no good at all."</p>

<p>Beth went upstairs without a word, and brought down the old aunt's
French books, and sat at the dining-table with one of them open before
her; but the sight of it recalled the happy summer days in the bright
little parlour looking out on the trees and flowers, and the dear old
lady with her delicate face sitting at the end of the table placidly
knitting while Beth prepared her lesson, and the tears welled up in her
eyes once more, and fell on the yellow pages.</p>

<p>"Beth," said her mother emphatically, "you must not go on like this. Why
are you so selfish? Don't <i>I</i> feel it too? Yet I control myself."</p>

<p>"You don't feel it as I do," Beth answered doggedly. "She was not so
much to you when she was here, how can you miss her so much now she has
gone?"</p>

<p>"But you have others to love," Mrs. Caldwell remonstrated. "She was not
your nearest relation."</p>

<p>"No, but she was the dearest," Beth replied. "I may have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> others to
love, but she was the one who loved me. She never said I had no
affection for any one; she never said I was selfish and thought of
nothing but my own interests. If she had to find fault with me, she did
it so that she made me want to be better. She was never unkind, she was
never unjust, and now I've lost her, I have no one."</p>

<p>"It is your own fault then," said Mrs. Caldwell, apt as usual to say the
kind of thing with which fatuous parents torment the genius-child. "You
are so determined not to be like other people that nobody can stand
you."</p>

<p>"I am not determined to be unlike other people," Beth exclaimed, turning
crimson with rage and pain. "I want to be like everybody else, and I
<i>am</i> like everybody else. And I am always ready to care for people too,
if they will let me. It isn't my fault if they don't like me."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> your fault," Mrs. Caldwell rejoined. "You have an unhappy knack
of separating yourself from every one. Look at your Uncle James. He can
hardly tolerate you."</p>

<p>"He's a fool, so that doesn't matter," said Beth, who always dealt
summarily with Uncle James. "I can't tolerate him. But you can't say I
separate myself from Aunt Grace Mary. She likes me, and she's kind; but
she's silly, and when I'm with her any time it makes me yawn. Is <i>that</i>
my fault? And did I separate myself from Kitty? Did I separate myself
from papa? Do I separate myself from Count Bartahlinsky? Have I
separated myself from Aunt Victoria?&mdash;and who else is there?"</p>

<p>"You gave Aunt Victoria plenty of trouble while she was here," Mrs.
Caldwell rejoined drily.</p>

<p>"Well, that is true, at all events," Beth answered in a broken voice;
and then she bowed her head on the old French grammar, and sobbed as if
her heart would break.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell looked up from her work at her from time to time frowning,
but she was too much ruffled by some of Beth's remarks to say anything
consoling; and Beth, absorbed in her grief, lost all consciousness of
everything outside herself.</p>

<p>At last, however, a kindly hand was laid on her head, and some one
stroked her hair.</p>

<p>"That is the way she goes on, and I don't know what to do with her,"
Mrs. Caldwell was saying. "Come, Beth, rouse yourself," she added
sharply.</p>

<p>Beth looked up, and found that it was Aunt Grace Mary who was stroking
her hair.</p>

<p>"Poor little body!" said Aunt Grace Mary as if she were speaking to an
infant, then added in a sprightly tone: "Come, dear! Come, dear! Wipe
your eyes. Mamma will be here directly&mdash;my mamma&mdash;and Uncle James, and
Mr. Watson."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are they coming for?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>your</i> mamma knows," Aunt Grace Mary answered archly. "Mr. Watson
was poor dear Aunt Victoria's lawyer, and he has brought her will, and
is going to read it to us."</p>

<p>"Am I to be sent out of the room?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Caldwell. "It isn't a matter for you at all."</p>

<p>"Everything is a matter for me that concerned Aunt Victoria," Beth
rejoined, "and if Lady Benyon is to be here, <i>I</i> shall stay."</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Caldwell could reply, Lady Benyon herself was ushered into
the little room with great deference by Uncle James. They were followed
by a little old gentleman dressed in black, with spectacles, and a pair
of badly-fitting black kid gloves. He shook hands with Mrs. Caldwell,
and then with Beth, whom he looked at over his spectacles shrewdly.
Uncle James also shook hands, and kissed his sister. "This is a solemn
occasion," he said, with emotion in his voice. Then he looked at Beth,
and added, "Had she not better go?"</p>

<p>Beth sat down beside Aunt Grace Mary, with her mouth obstinately set;
and Mrs. Caldwell, afraid of a scene, merely shrugged her shoulders
helplessly. Meanwhile the lawyer was blowing his nose, wiping his
spectacles, taking papers out of a pocket at the back of his frock-coat,
and settling himself at the table.</p>

<p>"You would like this young lady to retire, I suppose," said Uncle James
blandly.</p>

<p>"By no means," the little old gentleman answered, looking up at him over
his spectacles, and then at Beth. "By no means; let the young lady
remain."</p>

<p>Aunt Grace Mary put her arm round Beth. The lawyer broke the seal,
unfolded the will, and remarked by way of preface: "The document is in
the handwriting of the deceased. Ahem!"</p>

<p>Instantly into every face there came the expression that people wear in
church. Mr. Watson proceeded to read; but in a dry, distinct,
matter-of-fact tone, devoid of all emotion. A lawyer reading a will
aloud is sure of the interest of his audience, and, on this occasion, it
was evident that each member of the little group listened with strained
attention, but with very different feelings. What they gathered was that
Miss Victoria Bench, spinster, being of sound mind, did will and
bequeath everything of which she might die possessed to her beloved
great-niece, Elizabeth Caldwell, commonly called Beth. Should Beth
marry, the money was to be settled upon her for her exclusive use. The
present income from the property, about fifty pounds a year, was to be
devoted to the education of the said Elizabeth Caldwell, commonly called
Beth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle James's jaw dropped during the reading. "But," he stammered when
it was over, "if the investments recover?"</p>

<p>"Then Miss Elizabeth Caldwell, commonly called Beth, will have an income
of between six and seven hundred a year, <i>at least</i>," said the lawyer,
smiling.</p>

<p>Aunt Grace Mary clasped Beth close in a spasm of congratulation. Mrs.
Caldwell burst into tears. Beth herself, with an unmoved countenance,
perceived the disgust of Uncle James, her mother's emotion, and
something like amusement in Lady Benyon's face; and she also perceived,
but at a great distance as it were, that there was a dim prospect of
some change for the better in her life.</p>

<p>"Poor little body!" said Aunt Grace Mary, caressing her.</p>

<p>"Rich little body!" said Lady Benyon. "Come and kiss me, Puck, and let
me congratulate you."</p>

<p>"It is very nice for you, Beth, I am sure," said Mrs. Caldwell
plaintively, holding out her hand to Beth as she passed. Beth accepted
this also as a congratulation, and stooped and kissed her mother. Then
the lawyer got up and shook hands with her, and thereupon Uncle James,
feeling forced for decency's sake to do something, observed pointedly:
"I suppose Miss Victoria Bench was quite sane when she made this
bequest?"</p>

<p>"I should say that your supposition was correct," said the lawyer. "Miss
Victoria Bench always seemed to me to be an eminently sane person."</p>

<p>There was no allusion whatever to Uncle James in Aunt Victoria's will.
She thanked her niece, Caroline Caldwell, kindly for the shelter she had
given her in her misfortune, and hoped that by providing for Beth she
would relieve her mother's mind of all anxiety about the child, to whom,
she proceeded to state, she left all she had in proof of the tender
affection she felt for the child, and in return for the disinterested
love and duty she had received from Beth. Aunt Victoria wished Beth to
have her room when she was gone, in order that Beth might, as she grew
up, have proper privacy in her life, with undisturbed leisure for study,
reflection, and prayer. She added that she considered Beth a child of
exceptional temperament, that peculiar care and kindness would be
necessary to develop her character; but Miss Victoria hoped, prayed, and
believed that, with the help of the excellent abilities with which she
had been endowed, Beth would not only work out her own salvation
eventually, but do something notable to the glory of God and for the
good of mankind.</p>

<p>Beth's heart glowed when she heard this passage, and ever afterwards,
when she recalled it, she felt strangely stimulated.</p>

<p>After the last solemn words of the will had been read, and the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> little
scene of congratulation had been enacted, there was a pause in the
proceedings, then Uncle James remarked in his happiest manner: "The
importance which old ladies attach to their little bequests is only to
be equalled by the strength of their sentiments, and the grandeur of the
language in which they are expressed. One would think a principality was
being bequeathed to a princess, instead of a few pounds to an obscure
little girl, to judge by the tone of the whole document. Well, well!"</p>

<p>Beth looked at him, then drew down the corners of her mouth
impertinently. "There is one thing I can console you with, Uncle James,"
she said. "You may be quite sure that when I do come into my kingdom, I
shall carefully conceal the fact that I am any relation of yours."</p>

<p>Later in the day, Beth found her mother sitting in her accustomed place
by the dining-table, rocking herself sideways over her work, and with a
worried expression of countenance, as if she were uneasy in her mind.</p>

<p>"Aren't you pleased, mamma," said Beth, "that I should be left the
money?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course, my dear child," Mrs. Caldwell rejoined. Her tone
to Beth had altered very much since the morning. Even in a few short
hours Beth had been made to feel that mere money was making her a person
of more importance than she had ever before been considered.</p>

<p>Her mother had stopped short, but Beth waited, and Mrs. Caldwell
recommenced: "I am delighted on your account. Only, I was just thinking.
The money is of no use to you just now, and it would have made all the
difference to Jim. He ought to be making friends now who will last him
his life and help him on in his career; but he can do nothing without an
allowance, and I cannot make him one. There is no hurry for your
education. In fact, I think it would be better for your health if you
were not taught too much at present. But you shall have your aunt's
room, Beth, to study in if you like. You may even sleep there, although
I shall feel it when you leave mine. It will be breaking up the family.
That remark in the will about proper privacy seems to me great nonsense,
and you know I am not legally bound to give you a room to yourself.
However, it was the dear old lady's last request to me, and that makes
it sacred, so it shall be carried out to the letter. The room is yours,
and I hope you will enjoy your privacy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>shall</i>," Beth exclaimed with uncomplimentary fervour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell sighed and sewed on in silence for a little.</p>

<p>"The dear old lady left you the money because she believed you would do
some good with it," she resumed. "'For the good of mankind.' Those are
her own words. And I do think that is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
 rather your line, Beth; and what
greater good can you do to begin with than help your brother on in the
world? To spend the money on him instead of on yourself would really be
a fine, unselfish thing to do."</p>

<p>Beth's great grey eyes dilated; the prospect was alluring. "I suppose
there would not be enough for both of us?" she ventured
tentatively&mdash;"enough for me to be taught some <i>few</i> things properly, you
know&mdash;English, music, French."</p>

<p>"On fifty pounds a year, my dear child!" her mother exclaimed
sorrowfully. "Fifty pounds goes no way at all." Beth sighed. "Besides,"
Mrs. Caldwell pursued, "<i>I</i> can teach you all these things. You've got
beyond your childish tiresomeness now, and have only to ask, and then I
will tell you all you don't know. It would be a pleasure and an
occupation for me, and indeed, Beth, I have very little pleasure in
life. The days are long and lonely." Beth looked up with sudden
sympathy. "But if you will let me give you the lessons, and earn the
money, I could send it to Jim, and that would comfort me greatly, and
add also to <i>your</i> happiness, I should think."</p>

<p>It was not in Beth to resist such an appeal. She always forgot herself
at the first symptom of sorrow or suffering in another, and never
considered her own interests if she could help somebody else by
sacrificing them.</p>

<p>"It <i>would</i> add to my happiness," she answered brightly. "And if you
will just explain to me, mamma, when I don't understand things, I shall
remember all right, and not be a bother to you. Will you be kind to me,
and not scold me, and jeer at me, and make my life a burden to me? When
you do that, I hate you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell stopped short with her needle up in the air, in the act of
drawing the thread through her work. She was inexpressibly shocked.</p>

<p>"Hate your mother, Beth!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"I know it's abominable," said Beth, filled with compunction; "but I
can't help it. It's the devil, I suppose. He gets hold of us both, and
makes you torment me, and makes me&mdash;not like you for it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell quietly resumed her sewing. She was too much startled by
this glimpse of herself from Beth's point of view to say another word on
the subject; and a long silence ensued, during which she saw herself as
a sadly misunderstood mother. She determined, however, to try and manage
Beth on a new principle.</p>

<p>"I should like to help you to make the best of yourself, Beth," she
burst out again abruptly; "and I think I can. You are a tall girl for
your age, and are beginning to hold yourself

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> well already. Your poor
dear aunt was very particular to teach you that. And you have the
complexion of the Bench family, if you will take care of it. You should
wash your face in buttermilk at night after being out in the sun. I'll
get you some, and I'll get you a parasol for the summer. Your hands are
not nearly so coarse as they used to be, and they would really be quite
nice if you attended to them properly. All your father's people had good
hands and feet. I must see to your gloves and boots. I don't know what
your waist is going to be, but you shall have some good stays. A fine
shape goes a long way. With your prospects you really ought to make a
good match, so do not slouch about any more as if you had no
self-respect at all. You can really do a great deal to make yourself
attractive in appearance. Your Uncle William Caldwell had a very ugly
nose, but he pinched it, and pinched it every day to get it into shape,
until at last he made it quite a good one."</p>

<p>Bernadine came into the room in time to hear this story, and was so
impressed by it that she tried the same experiment on her own nose
without asking if it were ugly or not, and pinched it and rubbed it so
diligently that by the time it was formed she had thickened it and
changed it from a good ordinary nose into something quite original.</p>

<p>This was the kind of thing that happened to ladies in the days when true
womanliness consisted in knowing nothing accurately, and always taking
advice. Efforts to improve themselves in some such way were common
enough among marriageable maidens, and their mothers helped them to the
best of their ability with equally happy hints. Because small feet were
a beauty, therefore feet already in perfect proportion must be squeezed
to reduce their size till they were all deformed; and because
slenderness was considered elegant, therefore naturally well-formed
women must compress their bodies till they looked like cylinders or
hour-glasses, and lace till their noses swelled and their hair fell out.
Never having heard of proportion, all their ambition was to reduce
themselves to something less than they were designed to be. Those were
the days when women had "no nonsense about them, sir, I tell you," none
of those new-fangled ideas about education and that.</p>

<p>It was a new notion to Beth that she could do anything to make herself
attractive, and she took a solemn interest in it. She listened with
absolute faith to all that her mother said on the subject, and
determined to be high-principled and make the most of herself. When her
mother talked to her in this genial friendly way, instead of carping at
her or ignoring her, Beth's heart expanded and she was ready to do
anything to please her. Lessons

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
on the new method went on without
friction. Beth never suspected that her mother was unequal to the task
of educating her in any true sense of the word; her mother never
suspected it, neither did anybody else; and Beth had it all her own way.
If she were idle, her mother excused her; if she brought a lesson only
half-learnt, her mother prompted her all through; if she asked
questions, her mother answered them pleasantly; so that they got on very
well together, and everybody was satisfied&mdash;especially Jim, who was
benefiting by Aunt Victoria's bequest to the extent of being able to
keep up with the best of his bar-loafing acquaintances.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> she did what Aunt Victoria approved,
Beth felt that she was making
Aunt Victoria happy. Her dead were never far from her, never beyond
recall. She conquered her pride for Aunt Victoria's sake, and began to
go out again with her mother for the morning walk that winter unasked;
but Mrs. Caldwell seemed indifferent to the attention. She let Beth walk
beside her day after day, but remained absorbed in her own reflections,
and made no effort to talk to Beth and take her out of herself; so that
Beth very soon found the duty intolerably irksome. It irritated her,
too, when she caught her mother smiling to herself, and on asking what
was amusing her, Mrs. Caldwell replied, still smiling, "Never <i>you</i>
mind." With Beth's temperament it was not possible that the sense of
duty would long survive such snubs. Gradually she began to wander off by
herself again, leaving her mother pacing up and down the particular
sheltered terrace overlooking the sea on which she always walked at that
hour, and Bernadine playing about the cliffs or the desolate shore.</p>

<p>The whole place was desolate and melancholy at that time of the year.
The wind-swept streets were generally deserted, and the few people who
ventured out looked cold and miserable in their winter wraps. When a
gleam of sunshine enlivened the sky, the sailors would stand at the top
of the steps that led down on to the pier, with their hands in their
trousers-pockets, chewing tobacco, and straining their eyes out seaward
as if they were watching for something special; and Beth would stand
there among them, and look out too&mdash;out, far beyond the range of their
mental vision, eastwards, to summer lands whence the swallows came,
where the soft air was perfumed with flowers, and there was brightness
and warmth and ease, and the sea itself, so full of complaint down below
there, raged no more, neither lamented,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> but sang. And there Aunt
Victoria would be, sitting somewhere out of doors under the trees, with
good things, books and work and fruit and flowers, piled up on a little
table beside her, and every wish of her heart gratified, looking
serenely happy, and smiling and nodding and beckoning to Beth. But
following fast upon the vision, Aunt Victoria would be beside her in the
bitter wind, wearing her old brown dress with white spots that was far
too thin, and making believe that she did not shiver; then they had
returned from the morning walk, and Aunt Victoria was pausing a moment
at the bottom of the stairs to look up, as if measuring her strength and
the distance, before she took hold of the bannister and began to mount
wearily, but never once trusting herself to glance towards Bernadine and
the bread, lest something should be seen in her face which she chose to
conceal. From that vision Beth would fly down the steps to the sands,
and escape it in a healthy race with the turgid waves that came cresting
in and broke on the barren shore.</p>

<p>Then one day, suddenly, as it seemed, a bird sang. The winter was over,
spring was upon the land again, and Beth looked up and smiled. The old
pear-tree in the little garden at the back was a white wonder of
blossom, and, in front, in the orchard opposite, the apple-trees blushed
with a tinge of pink. Beth, seeing them one morning very early from her
bed in Aunt Victoria's room, arose at once, rejoicing, and threw the
window wide open. Beth might have used the same word to express the good
and the beautiful, as the Greeks did, so inseparably were the two
associated in her mind. At this stage of her development she felt very
literally&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heavens are telling the glory of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wonder of His works displays the firmament."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"O Lord, how wondrous are Thy works," she chanted to herself softly, as
she gazed, awe-stricken, at the loveliness of the rose-tinged foam on
the fruit-trees, and her whole being was thrilled with gratitude for the
beauty of earth. She took deep draughts of the sweet morning air, and,
like the Indian devotee, she breathed a sacred word with every breath.
But passive ecstasy was not enough for Beth. Her fine feelings strove
for expression always in some fine act, and as she stood at the window
she made good resolutions. Her life should be ordered to worthy purposes
from morning till night. She would in future begin the day by getting up
to greet the dawn in an ecstasy of devotion. Not a minute later than
daybreak would do for her. All Beth's efforts aimed at an extreme.</p>

<p>She idled most of that day away in contemplation of her project, and she
was as dilatory and troublesome as she could

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> be, doing nothing she
ought to have done, because her mind was so full of all the things she
was going to do. What she feared was that she would never be able to
wake herself in time, and she went to bed at a preposterously early
hour, and sat long in her night-dress, thinking how to manage it. At
last it occurred to her that if she tied her great toe to the bed-post
with a piece of string, it would give her a jerk when she moved, and so
awake her.</p>

<p>The contrivance answered only too well. She could not sleep for a long
time, and when at last she dropped off, she was almost immediately
awakened by a pitiless jerk from the string. She had Aunt Victoria's old
watch under her pillow, and lighted a match to see the time. It was only
twelve. When would the day break? She turned, and tossed, and fidgeted.
The string on her toe was very uncomfortable, but nothing would have
induced her to be so weak as to take it off. One, two, three, she heard
the church-clock strike, but it was still pitch dark. Then she dozed off
again, but in a minute, as it seemed to her, she was re-aroused by the
string. She gave a great weary sigh and opened her eyes. It was all grey
daylight in the room.</p>

<p>Beth was out of bed as soon as she could get the string off her toe. The
water was very cold, and she shivered and yawned and stretched over it,
but washed herself with exaggerated conscientiousness all the same, then
huddled on her clothes, and stood awhile, not knowing quite what to do
next. She had slept with the window open, and now she drew up the blind.
Under the leaden sky the apple-trees showed no tinge of colour, and it
was as if white sheets had been spread out over them for the night. Beth
thought of curl-papers and rooms all covered up from the dust when
Harriet was sweeping, and felt no enthusiasm. She was on the west side
of the house, and could not therefore see the sun rise; but she must see
the sunrise&mdash;sunrise&mdash;sunrise. She had never seen the sunrise. The sea
was east. It would rise over the sea. The sea at sunrise! The very
thought of it took her breath away. She put on her things and slipped
into the acting-room. Her mother took the front-door key up to her room
with her when she went to bed at night, so that the only way out was by
the acting-room window. Beth swung herself round the bar, crept
cautiously down the tiles to the pump, jumped to the ground, then ran up
the entry, and let herself out by the back-gate into the street. There
she was seized upon by a great feeling of freedom. She threw up her
arms, filled her lungs with a deep breath, and ran. There was not a soul
to be seen. The town was hers!</p>

<p>She made for a lonely spot on the cliff, where a stream fell in a
cataract on to the sand, and there was a rustic seat with a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> lovely view
of the bay. Beth dropped on to the seat out of breath and looked
curiously about her. The tide was high. The water, smooth, sullen,
swollen and weary, broke on the shore in waves so small that it seemed
as if the sea, tired of its endless task, were doing dispiritedly as
little as it dared, and murmuring at that. The curving cliffs on the
left looked like white curtains, closely drawn. The low grey sky was
unbroken by cloud or rift except low down on the horizon, where it had
risen like a blind drawn up a little to admit the light. It was a
melancholy prospect, and Beth shivered and sighed in sympathy. Then a
sparrow cheeped somewhere behind her, and another bird in the hedge
softly fluted a little roulade. Beth looked round to see what it was,
and at that moment the light brightened as if it had been suddenly
turned up. She looked at the sea again. The rift in the leaden sky had
lengthened and widened, and the first pale primrose of the dawn showed
beyond. A faint flush followed, and then it seemed as if the night sky
slowly rolled itself up and was put away, leaving a floor of silver,
deepening to lilac, for the first bright beam to disport itself upon.
Then the sea smiled, and the weariness of it, back and forth, back and
forth, passed into animation. Its smooth surface became diapered with
light airs, and moved with a gentle roll. The sullen murmur rose to a
morning song, and a boat with bare mast at anchor in the bay, the only
one in sight, rocked to the tune. A great sea-bird sailed by, gazing
down into the depths with piercing eyes, and a grey gull flew so close
to the water, it seemed as if his wings must dip at every flap. The sky
by this time was all a riot of colour, at which Beth gazed in
admiration, but without rapture. Her intellect acknowledged its
loveliness, but did not delight in it&mdash;heart and soul were untouched.
The spirit of the dawn refused to speak to her. She had exhausted
herself in her effort to induce the intoxication of devotion which had
come to her spontaneously the day before. The great spirit does not want
martyrs. Joy in beauty and goodness comes of a pure and tranquil mind,
not of a tortured body. The faces of the holy ones are calm and their
souls serene.</p>

<p>A little farm-house stood back from the road just behind the seat where
Beth was sitting, and a tall gaunt elderly man, with a beard on his
chin, came out presently and stood staring grimly at the sunrise. Then
he crossed the road deliberately, sat down at the other end of the seat,
and stared at Beth.</p>

<p>"You're early out," he said at last.</p>

<p>Beth detected something hostile in the tone, and fixed her big fearless
grey eyes upon him defiantly. "It's a free country," she said.</p>

<p>"Free or not," he answered drily, "it isn't fit fur no young

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> gell to be
out alone at sechun a time. Ye should be indoors gettin' the breakfast."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Beth, "I've no need to get the breakfast."</p>

<p>"Well, it makes it all the worse," he rejoined; "fur if ye're by way o'
bein' a lady, it not on'y means that ye're out wi' no one to tak' care
of ye, but that ye've niver been taught to tak' care o' yerself. Lady!"
he ejaculated. "Pride and patches! Tak' my advice, <i>lady</i>, go back to
yer bed, get yer meed o' sleep, wak' up refreshed, and set to work."</p>

<p>He spat on the grass in a self-satisfied way when he had spoken, and
contemplated the sunrise like a man who has done his duty and earned the
right to repose.</p>

<p>Beth got up and walked home despondently. She climbed in at the
acting-room window, and went to her own room. The sun was shining on the
apple-blossom in the orchard opposite, and she looked for the charm of
yesterday, but finding only the garish commonplace of fruit-trees in
flower with the sun on them, she drew down the blind. Then she took off
her hat and jacket, threw herself on her bed, and fell into a heavy
sleep, with her brow puckered and the corners of her mouth drooping
discontentedly.</p>

<p>The next night she determined to take her meed of sleep, and did not tie
the string to her toe. It had been a long lonely day, filled with great
dissatisfaction and vague yearnings for companionship; but when she fell
asleep she had a happy dream, so vivid that it seemed more real than
anything she had seen in her morning ramble. It was eight o'clock in the
evening, she dreamt, and there was some one waiting for her under the
pear-tree in the garden. The night air was fresh and fragrant. The
moonlight shone on the white blossoms overhead, which clustered so close
that no ray penetrated to the ground beneath, so that there all was
shadowy, but still she could see that there was some one standing in the
shade, and she knew that he was waiting for her. She had never seen him
before, yet she knew him well and hurried to meet him; and he took her
in his arms and kissed her, and his kisses thrilled her with a thrill
that remained with her for many a day.</p>

<p>She got up the moment she awoke, and looked about her in a kind of
amaze, for everything she saw was transfigured. It was in herself,
however, that the light burned which made the world so radiant. As the
old apple-trees, warmed by the sun, suddenly blossomed into bridal
beauty in the spring, so, in the silent night, between sundown and
day-dawn, while she slept, yet another petal of her own manifold nature
had unfolded, and in the glow of its loveliness there was nothing of
commonplace aspect; for a new joy in life was hers which helped her to
discover in all things a hitherto unsuspected charm.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth's little life had been full of childish irregularities, the little
duties being continually slurred and neglected that the little pleasures
might be indulged in the sooner. She was apt to regard bathing,
hair-brushing, dressing, and lessons as mere hindrances to some of the
particular great businesses of life which specially occupied
her&mdash;verse-making, for instance, piano-playing, poaching, or praying,
whichever happened to be the predominant interest of the moment. But
now, on a sudden, the care of her person became of extraordinary
importance. All the hints, good and bad, she had had on the subject
recurred to her, and she began to put them into practice systematically.
She threw the clothes back from her bed to air it the moment she got up,
that it might be fresh and sweet to sleep in. Her little bath had
hitherto been used somewhat irregularly, but now she fetched hot and
cold water for herself, and bathed every day. She brushed her hair
glossy, and tightened her stays to make her waist small, and she was
sorely dissatisfied because her boots did not pinch her feet. She began
to take great care of her hands too, and would do no dusting without
gloves on, or dirty work of any kind that was calculated to injure them.
She used a parasol when she could, and if she got sunburnt bathing or
boating, she washed her face in buttermilk at night, fetched from
Fairholm regularly for the purpose. The minds and habits of the young
are apt to form themselves in this way out of suggestions let fall by
all kinds of people, the worst and most foolish as well as the wisest
and best.</p>

<p>Beth longed that morning for something new and smart to wear. Her old
black things looked so rusty in the spring sunshine, she could not
satisfy herself with anything she had. All Aunt Victoria's possessions
were hers, and she examined her boxes, looking for something to enliven
her own sombre dress, and found some lace which she turned into a collar
and cuffs and sewed on. When she saw herself in the glass with this
becoming addition to her dress, her face brightened at the effect. She
knew that Aunt Victoria would have been pleased to see her look like
that&mdash;she was always pleased when Beth looked well; and now, when Beth
recollected her sympathy, all the great fountain of love in her brimmed
over, and streamed away in happy little waves, to break about the dear
old aunt somewhere on the foreshore of eternity, and to add, perhaps,
who knows how or what to her bliss.</p>

<p>When Beth went down to breakfast, she was very hungry, but there was
only one little bloater, which must be left for mamma to divide with
Bernadine. There was not much butter either, so Beth took her toast
nearly dry, and her thin coffee with very little milk and no sugar in
it, also for economical reasons; but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
 the coffee was hot, and she was
happy. Her happiness bubbled up in bright little remarks, which
brightened her mother too.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Beth, taking advantage of her mood, "it's a poor heart
that never rejoices. Let's have a holiday, you and I, to celebrate the
summer."</p>

<p>"But the summer hasn't come," Mrs. Caldwell objected, smiling.</p>

<p>"But summer is coming, is coming," Beth chanted, "and I want to make a
song about it."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> make a song!" Bernadine exclaimed. "Why, you can't spell summer."</p>

<p>Beth made a face at her. "I know you want a holiday, mamma," she
resumed. "Come, confess! I work you to death. And there's church to-day
at eleven, and I want to go."</p>

<p>"Well, if you want to go to church," said Mrs. Caldwell, relieved.</p>

<p>Beth did not wait to hear the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>She went to the drawing-room first, and sat down at the little rosewood
piano with a volume of Moore's "Lalla Rookh" open before her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From the mountain's warbling fount I come,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she chanted, with her eyes fixed on the words, but she played as if she
were reading notes. She wove all the poems she loved to music in this
way, and played and sang them softly to herself by the hour together.</p>

<p>The Lenten service in the church at the end of the road was but poorly
attended. There were not more than a dozen people present; but Beth,
seated beside the door, enjoyed it. She was all fervour now, and every
emotional exercise was a pleasure.</p>

<p>After the service she strolled down the quaintly irregular front street,
which was all red brick houses with small window-panes, three to the
width of the window, except where an aspiring tradesman had introduced
plate-glass and a vulgar disguise of stucco, which converted the
warm-toned bricks into commonplace colourless greyness. It was on one
side of this street that the principal shops were, and Beth stood for
some time gazing at a print in a stationer's window&mdash;a lovely little
composition of waves lapping in gently towards a sheltered nook on a
sandy beach. Beth, wafted there instantly, heard the dreamy murmur and
felt the delicious freshness of the sea, yet the picture did not satisfy
her.</p>

<p>"I should want somebody," she broke out in herself. "I should want
somebody&mdash;somebody to lay my head against. Ah, dear Lord, how I hate to
be alone!"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>Old Lady Benyon, at her post of observation in the big bow-window at
the top of the street, saw Beth standing there, and speculated.
"Gracious, how that child grows!" she exclaimed. "She'll be a woman
directly."</p>

<p>As Beth went on down the street, she began to suffer from that dull
irresolute feeling which comes of a want of purpose. She wanted a
companion and she wanted an object. Presently she met a young man who
looked at her intently as they approached each other, and as he looked
his face brightened. Beth's pulse quickened pleasurably and her colour
rose. Her steps became buoyant. She held up her head and glowed with
animation, but was unaware of the source of this sudden happy stimulant,
nor did she try to discover it. She was living her experiences then,
by-and-by she would reflect upon them, then inevitably she would
reproduce them, and all without intention. As the sun rises, as the
birds build, so would she work when the right time came. Talent may
manufacture to order, but works of genius are the outcome of an
irresistible impulse, a craving to express something for its own sake
and the pleasure of expressing it, with no thought of anything beyond.
It is talent that thinks first of all of applause and profits, and only
works to secure them&mdash;works for the result, for the end in view&mdash;never
for love of the work.</p>

<p>Beth's heart had no satisfaction at home; she had no friend of her own
sex to fill it as most girls have, and a nature like hers, rich in every
healthy possibility, was bound to crave for love early. It was all very
well for her mother and society as it is constituted to ignore the needs
of nature; by Beth herself they would not be ignored. In most people,
whether the senses or the intellect will have the upper-hand is very
much a matter of early training.</p>

<p>Because she was a girl, Beth's intellect had been left to stagnate for
want of proper occupation or to run riot in any vain pursuit she might
happen upon by accident, while her senses were allowed to have their
way, unrestrained by any but the vaguest principles. Thanks to her free
roving outdoor habits, her life was healthy if it were not happy, and
she promised to mature early. Youth and sex already began to hang out
their signals&mdash;clear skin, slim figure, light step, white teeth, thick
hair, bright eyes. She was approaching her blossoming time, the end of
her wintry childhood, the beginning of a promising spring. It was
natural and right that her pulses should quicken and her spirits rise
when a young man met her with a friendly glance. Her whole being was
suffused with the glory of love, and her mind held the vision; but it
was of an abstract kind as yet, not inspired by man. It was in herself
that the emotion arose, in happy exuberance, and bubbled over, expending
itself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
 various forms of energy until it should find one object to
concentrate itself upon. There comes a time to all healthy young people
when Nature says: "Mate, my children, and be happy." If the impulse come
prematurely, it is not the young people, but the old ones that are to
blame; they should have seen to it that the intellect, which acts as a
curb on the senses when properly trained and occupied, developed first.
Beth was just at the age when the half-educated girl has nothing to
distract her but her own emotions. Her religion, and the young men who
are beginning to make eyes at her, interest her then about equally, and
in much the same way; she owes to each a pleasurable sensation. If she
can combine the two under one roof, as in church, they suffice and her
happiness is complete. It cannot be said, however, that the senses awoke
before the intellect in Beth; but because of the irregularities of her
training, the want of discipline and order, they took possession of her
first.</p>

<p>Passing a shop-window, Beth caught a reflection of herself in the
polished pane, and saw that her skirt hung badly: it dipped too much
behind. She stopped to gauge the length, that she might alter it when
she went in, and then she noticed the pretty light summer things
displayed in the window, and ached to possess some. She was miserably
conscious of her old ill-cut skirt, more especially of the invisible
dirt on it, and she did so yearn for something new and sweet and clean.
Her mother had a bill at that shop&mdash;should she&mdash;should she just go in
and ask about prices? No, she could not in that horrid old frock; the
shopman would not respect her. She had intended to go down to the sands
and sit by the sea, and wait for things to come to her, by which she
meant ideas; but the discomfort of mind set up by that glimpse of her
uncouth clothes, and the horrible sense of their want of freshness,
gained upon her, and drove her in hurriedly. Beth would have expressed
the dainty refinement of her mind in her dress had she had the means;
but it is difficult to be dainty on nothing a year.</p>

<p>The rest of the day she spent in her room sewing. She found that one of
Aunt Victoria's summer silks would fit her with very little alteration,
and set to work to make a Sunday frock of it. As she worked she thought
of the dear old lady, and of the hours they had sat there together
sewing, and of their teas and talks. She would not have known how to
alter that dress but for Aunt Victoria; it made her both sad and glad to
remember how much she owed her.</p>

<p>Later in the day, after dinner, when the sun had set and the darkness
was beginning to gather, Beth became aware of a curious sensation. It
was as if she were expecting something delightful to happen, and yet, at
the same time, was all aching

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
 with anxiety. Then suddenly she
remembered her dream. The old pear-tree was a pyramid of blossom. Should
she go and see the white foam-flowers by moonlight? The moon had risen.</p>

<p>She stole out into the garden, anxious above everything to go alone. Her
heart throbbed curiously; what did she expect? The young moon hung in an
indigo sky, and there were some white stars. The air was fresh and
fragrant as it had been in her dream, but there was less light. She had
to peer into the shade beneath the pear-tree to see&mdash;to see what? If
there were any one there? Of course there was no one there! How could
there be? She did not trust herself closer, however, until she was quite
sure that there was nothing to encounter but the trunk of the tree. Then
she went bravely, and reclined on the see-saw board, looking up through
the black branches to the clustering blossoms that shone so white on the
topmost twigs in the moonlight. And presently she began to glow with a
great feeling of exultation. It began in her chest, and spread, as from
a centre, all over her. The details of her dream recurred to her, the
close clasp, the tender kiss, and she thrilled again at the
recollection.</p>

<p>But, for the present, the recollection was enough.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Sunday morning Beth went down to breakfast
 dressed in Aunt Victoria's
light lavender silk, remodelled to suit her; and very becoming she had
made it. But Mrs. Caldwell called it an absurd costume for a girl of her
age, and said she looked ridiculously over-dressed; so Beth went back to
her room disheartened, and reappeared at church-time, with drooping
mouth, in the old black frock she usually wore on Sundays.</p>

<p>Vainly she tried to rouse herself to any fervour of worship during the
first part of the service. She felt ill-dressed, uncomfortable,
dissatisfied, and would have been glad to quarrel with anybody. Then
suddenly, during the singing of a hymn, she ceased to be self-conscious.
All the trouble left her, and was succeeded by that curious thrill of
happy expectation which came to her continually at this time. She looked
about her and saw friendly faces where before she had seen nothing but
criticism and disdain of her shabby clothes.</p>

<p>Those were the days of pew-letting. The nearer you sat to the pulpit,
the higher the price of the pew, and the better your social position.
Mrs. Caldwell was obliged to content herself with a cheap seat in one of
the side aisles near the door, so the vicar had never called on her. He
only called on a few front

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
 rows. His own pew was high in the chancel,
where all the parish could gaze at his exhausted wife and her increasing
family. His pupils used to sit in the pew opposite; but the bishop,
having received complaints from the neglected parish, had lately
interfered and stopped the school; and henceforth Mr. Richardson was
only to be allowed to have one pupil. Mr. Richardson determined to make
him profitable.</p>

<p>From where she sat Beth could see the vicar's pew in the chancel, and
she had noticed a tall slender youth sitting at the far end, near the
vestry door, but he did not interest her at first; now, however, she
looked at him again, and wondered who he was, and presently she found
that he was gazing at her intently. Then their eyes met, and it was as
if a spark of fire had kindled a glow in her chest, high up near the
throat, where the breath catches. She looked down at her book, but had
no thought on the subject at all&mdash;she was all one sensation. Light had
come to her, a wondrous flood of amber light, that blotted out the
common congregation and all besides, but him and her. Yet she could
hardly sit through the service, and the moment it was over she fled. Her
great desire was to be alone, if that could be called solitude which
contained all the satisfaction of the closest companionship. All the
time that she was flying, however, she felt that she was being pursued,
and there was the strangest excitement and delight in the sensation. But
she never looked behind. She did not dare to.</p>

<p>She made for the cliffs on the Fairholm estate, and when she came to
them her intention was to hide herself. There was a nook she knew, some
distance on, a grassy space on the cliff side, not visible either from
above or below. She climbed down to it, and there ensconced herself.
Beneath was a little cove sheltered from the north and south by the
jutting cliffs, and floored with the firmest sand just then, for the
tide was out. Beth was lying in the shadow of the cliff, but, beyond,
the sun shone, the water sparkled, the sonorous sea-voice sounded from
afar, while little laughing waves broke out into merry music all along
the shore. Beth, lying on her face with her arms folded in front of her
and her cheek resting on them, looked out, lithe, young, strong,
bursting with exultation, but motionless as a manifestation of inanimate
nature. That was a beautiful pause in her troublous day. Never mind if
it only endured for an hour, there was certainty in it, a happy
certainty. From the moment their eyes had met she was sure, she knew he
would come.</p>

<p>The little waves rang out their laughing carillons, light grace notes to
the deep solemn melody of earth and air and sea; and Beth, watching with
dilated pupils and set countenance, listened intently. And presently,
below, on her left, round the headland

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
 some one came striding. Beth's
bright eyes flashed with a vivid interest, but she shrank back,
flattening herself down on the rank grass, as though thereby she made
herself the more invisible.</p>

<p>The young man stopped, took off his hat and wiped his forehead, glanced
this way and that round the cove and out to sea, like one bewildered,
who has expected to find something which is not there, and begins to
look for it in the most unlikely places. Hesitating, disappointed,
uncertain, he moved a little on in one direction, a little back in the
other, then, drawn by a sudden impulse, that most familiar manifestation
of the ruling force which disposes of us all, we know not how, he walked
up the cove with swift, strong, buoyant steps, as if with a purpose,
swinging his hat in his hand as he came, and threw himself full length
on the smooth, hard, shining sand, and sighed a deep sigh of
satisfaction, as though he knew himself within reach of what he sought.
In certain states of ecstatic feeling a faculty is released which takes
cognisance of things beyond the ken of our beclouded intellects, and
although in the language of mind he did not know, it may be that from
the region of pure spirit there had come to him a subtle perception, not
to be defined, which made it more desirable to be there on that spot
alone than anywhere else in the world with no matter whom.</p>

<p>He was a young man of seventeen or eighteen, slenderly built, with
well-shaped feet, and long, delicate, nervous hands. His face was shaved
clean of the down of his adolescence, so that his somewhat sallow
complexion looked smooth to effeminacy. His features were regular and
refined, and his fine brown curly hair was a shade lighter in colour
than his skin&mdash;which produced a noticeable effect. His pale china-blue
eyes, too, showed the same peculiarity, which Beth, looking down on him
through the fringe of long rank grass in front of her, remarked, but
uncritically, for every inch of him was a joy to her.</p>

<p>She was passive. But the young man soon grew restless on his sandy
couch. He changed his position a dozen times, then suddenly got on his
knees, and heaped up a mound of sand, which, having patted it and
pressed it down as hard as it would set, he began to model. Beth held
her breath and became rigid with interest as she saw the shapeless mass
gradually transformed into some semblance of a human figure,
conventional as an Egyptian statue. When the young man had finished, he
sat beside the figure for some time, looking fixedly out to sea. Then he
turned to his work once more, and, after surveying it critically, he
began to make alterations, trying to improve upon what he had done; but
the result did not please him, and in a fit of exasperation he fell upon
the figure and demolished it. This

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
 seemed such a wanton outrage to Beth
that she uttered a low cry of remonstrance involuntarily, but the
exclamation mingled with the murmur of wind and wave, and was lost in
it. The young man looked disconcerted himself and ashamed, too, as a
child does when it has broken something in a rage and repents; and
presently he began to heap the mound once more. When it was done, he
stretched himself on the sand and shut his eyes, and for a long time
Beth lay still, looking down upon him.</p>

<p>All at once, however, the noise of the water became importunate. She had
not been aware of it at all since the young man appeared, but now it
came into her consciousness with the distinctness of a sudden and
unexpected sound, and she looked in that direction. The last time she
had noticed the tide it was far out; but now, where all had been sand
beyond the sheltered cove, all was water. The silver line stretched from
headland to headland, and was still advancing. Already there was no way
of escape by the sands, and the cove itself would be a bay in a little
while&mdash;a bay without a boat! If he did not wake and bestir himself, the
callous waves would come and cover him. Should she call? She was shy of
taking the initiative even to save his life, and hesitated a moment, and
in that moment there came a crash. The treacherous clay cliff crumbled,
and the great mass of it on which she was lying slid down bodily on to
the shining sand. The young man started up, roused by the rumbling. Had
he been a few feet nearer to the cliff he must have been buried alive.
He and Beth stared at each other stupidly, neither realising what had
happened for the first few minutes. He was the first to recover himself.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" he asked with concern, going forward to help her.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered, staggering to her feet. "No, I think not,"
she added. "I'm a little shaken. I'll sit down."</p>

<p>The sitting would have been a tumble had he not caught her in his arms
and held her up. Beth felt deadly sick for an instant, then she found
herself reclining on the sand, with the young man bending over her,
looking anxiously into her face.</p>

<p>"You're faint," he said.</p>

<p>"Is that faint?" she answered. "What a ghastly sensation! But there is
something I want to remember." She shut her eyes, then opened them, and
looked up at him with a puzzled expression. "It's very odd, I can't
remember," she complained.</p>

<p>The young man could not help her. He looked up at the cliff. "What were
you doing up there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What were you doing down there?" she rejoined.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"I followed you," he answered simply. "I saw you come this way, then I
lost sight of you; but I thought you would be somewhere on the sands,
because the cliffs are private property."</p>

<p>"The owner is an uncle of mine," said Beth. "I come when I like."</p>

<p>Then they looked into each other's faces shyly, and looked away again,
smiling but confused.</p>

<p>"Why did you follow me?" said Beth. "You did not know me."</p>

<p>"No, but I wanted to," he answered readily. "Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Lying on a shelf where that scar is now, looking down on you."</p>

<p>"Then you saw me model that figure?"</p>

<p>"And the cliff fell," Beth put in irrelevantly to cover a blush. "It
often falls. We're always having landslips here. And I think we'd better
move away from it now," she added, rising. "People are killed
sometimes."</p>

<p>"But tell me," he said, detaining her. "Didn't you know I was following
you?"</p>

<p>Beth became embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You did," he persisted, "and you ran away. Why did you run away?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," Beth confessed; then she uttered an exclamation.
"Look! look! the tide! What shall we do?"</p>

<p>He turned and saw their danger for the first time.</p>

<p>"Our only way of escape is by the cliffs," Beth said, "unless a boat
comes by."</p>

<p>"And the cliffs are perpendicular just here," he rejoined, after
carefully surveying them.</p>

<p>They looked into each other's faces blankly.</p>

<p>"I can't swim&mdash;can you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Beth shook her head.</p>

<p>"What is to be done?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done, I think," she answered quietly. "We may
see a boat, but hardly anybody ever comes along the cliffs. We might
shout, though."</p>

<p>They did so until they were hoarse, but there was no response, and the
tide came creeping up over the sand.</p>

<p>"How calm it is!" Beth observed.</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously. "I don't believe you're a bit afraid," he
said. "<i>I</i>'m in a desperate funk."</p>

<p>"I don't believe we're going to be drowned, and I always know what's
coming," she answered. Then after a little she asked him his name.</p>

<p>"Alfred," he answered; "and yours?"</p>

<p>"Beth&mdash;Beth Caldwell. Alfred!&mdash;I like Alfred."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like Beth. It's queer, but I like it all the better for that. It's
like you."</p>

<p>"Do you think me queer?" Beth asked, prepared to resent the imputation.</p>

<p>"I think you uncommon," he replied.</p>

<p>Beth reflected for a little. "What is your full name?" she asked
finally.</p>

<p>"Alfred Cayley Pounce," he replied. "My father gave me the name of
Alfred that I might always remember I was <i>A</i> Cayley Pounce. But my
ambition is to be <i>The</i> Cayley Pounce," he added with a nervous little
laugh.</p>

<p>Beth compressed her lips, and looked at the rising tide. The next wave
broke at their feet, and both involuntarily stepped back. Behind them
was the mass of earth that had fallen from the cliff. It had descended
in a solid wedge without scattering. Alfred climbed on to it, and helped
Beth up. "We shall be a little higher here, at all events," he said.</p>

<p>Beth looked along the cliff; the high-water mark was still above their
heads. "It's getting exciting, isn't it?" she observed. "But I don't
feel nasty. Having you here makes&mdash;makes a difference, you know."</p>

<p>"If you have to die with me, how shall you feel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I shall feel till my last gasp that I would much rather have lived with
you," she answered emphatically.</p>

<p>A wavelet splashed up against the clay on which they were standing. He
turned to the cliff and tore at it in a sort of exasperation, trying to
scoop out footholes with his hands by which they might climb up; but the
effort was futile, the soft shale crumbled as he scooped, and there was
no hold to be had on it. His face had grown grey in the last few
minutes, and his eyes were strained and anxious.</p>

<p>"I wonder how you feel," Beth said. "I think I resent the fate that
threatens us more than I fear it. If my life must end now, it will be so
unfinished."</p>

<p>He made no reply, and she stood looking out to sea thoughtfully. "It's
Sunday," she observed at last. "There won't be many boats about to-day."</p>

<p>The water had begun to creep up on to their last refuge; it washed over
her feet as she spoke, and she shrank back. Alfred put his arm round her
protectingly.</p>

<p>"Do you still believe we shall not be drowned?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "But, even if we were, it wouldn't be the end of
us. We have been here in this world before, you and I, and we shall come
again."</p>

<p>"What makes you think such queer things?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think them," she answered. "I know them. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> things I think
are generally all wrong; but the things I know about&mdash;that come to me
like this&mdash;are right. Only I can't command them. One comes to me now and
again like a flash, as that one did down there just now when I said we
should not be drowned; but if I put a question to myself, I can get no
answer."</p>

<p>The water had crept up over their feet while they were speaking. It was
coming in at a great rate, but there were no waves to splash them, only
a sort of gentle heave and ripple that brought it on insensibly, so that
it had lapped up to the cliff behind them before they suspected it. Beth
shivered as it rose around her.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing I changed my dress," she said suddenly. "That summer
silk would certainly have been spoilt."</p>

<p>Alfred held her tight, and looked down into her face, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking so many things," Beth broke out again. "I'm glad it's a
still day for one thing, and not freezing cold. The cold would have
numbed us, and we should have been swept off our feet if there had been
any waves. I want to ask you so many things. Why did you make that
figure on the sand?"</p>

<p>"I want to be a sculptor," he said; "but my people object, and they
won't let me have the proper materials to model in, so I model in
anything."</p>

<p>The water was almost up to Beth's waist. She had to turn and cling to
him to keep her footing. She hid her face on his shoulder, and they
stood so some time. The water rose above her waist. Alfred was head and
shoulders taller than she was. He realised that she would be covered
first.</p>

<p>"I must hold her up somehow," he muttered.</p>

<p>Beth raised her head. "Alfred," she began, "we're neither of us cowards,
are we? You are hating to die, I can see, but you're not going to make
an exhibition of yourself to the elements; and I'm hating it, too&mdash;I'm
horribly anxious&mdash;and the cold makes me sob in my breath as the water
comes up. It is like dying by inches from the feet up; but while my head
is alive, I defy death to make me whimper."</p>

<p>"Do you despair, then?" he exclaimed, as if there had been some
safeguard in her certainty.</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge at this moment," she answered. "I am in suspense.
But that is nothing. The things that have come to me like that on a
sudden positively have always been true, however much I might doubt and
question beforehand. I did know at that moment that we should not be
drowned; but I don't know it now. My spirit can't grasp the idea,
though, of being here in this comfortable body talking to you one
moment, and the next being turned out of house and home into eternity
alone."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not alone," he interrupted, clasping her closer. "I'll hold you tight
through all eternity."</p>

<p>Beth looked up at him, and then they kissed each other frankly, and
forgot their danger for a blissful interval.</p>

<p>They were keeping their foothold with difficulty now. The last heave of
the tide came up to Beth's shoulder, and took her breath away. Had it
not been for the support of the cliff behind them, they could not have
kept their position many minutes. But the cliff itself was a danger, for
the sea was eating into it, and might bring down another mass of it at
any moment. The agony of death, the last struggle with the water, had
begun.</p>

<p>"I hate it," Beth gasped, "but I'm not afraid."</p>

<p>The steady gentle heave of the sea was like the breathing of a placid
sleeper. It rose round them once more, up, up, over Beth's head. They
clung closer to each other and to the cliff, staggering and fighting for
their foothold. Then it sank back from them, then slowly came again,
rising in an irregular wavy line all along the face of the cliffs with a
sobbing sound as if in its great heart it shrank from the cruel deed it
was doing&mdash;rose and fell, rose and fell again.</p>

<p>Alfred's face was grey and distorted. He groaned aloud.</p>

<p>"Are you suffering?" Beth exclaimed. "Oh, I wish it was over."</p>

<p>She had really the more to suffer of the two, for every wave nearly
covered her; but her nerve and physique were better than his, and her
will was of iron. The only thing that disturbed her fortitude were the
signs of distress from him.</p>

<p>Gently, gently the water came creeping up and up again. It had swelled
so high the last time that Beth was all but gone; and now she held her
breath, expecting for certain to be overwhelmed. But, after a pause, it
went down once more, then rose again, and again subsided.</p>

<p>Alfred stood with shut eyes and clenched teeth, blindly resisting. Beth
kept her wits about her.</p>

<p>"Alfred!" she cried on a sudden, "I was right! I was not deceived! Stand
fast! The tide is on the turn."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and stared about him in a bewildered way. His face
was haggard and drawn from the strain, his strength all but exhausted;
he did not seem to understand.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Beth cried again. "You'll be a big sculptor yet. The tide has
turned. It's going out, Alfred, it's going out. It washed an inch lower
last time. Keep up! Keep up! O Lord, help me to hold him! help me to
hold him! It's funny," she went on, changing with one of her sudden
strange transitions from the part of actor to that of spectator, as it
were. "It's funny we neither of us prayed. People in danger do,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> as a
rule, they say in the books; but I never even thought of it."</p>

<p>The tide had seemed to come in galloping like a racehorse, but now it
crawled out like a snail; and they were both so utterly worn, that when
at last the water was shallow enough, they just sank down and sat in it,
leaning against each other, and yearning for what seemed to them the
most desirable thing on earth at that moment&mdash;a dry spot on which to
stretch themselves out and go to sleep.</p>

<p>"I know now what exhaustion is," said Beth, with her head on Alfred's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Beth," he rejoined with a wan smile, "you've been picking
up information ever since you fell acquainted with me here. I can count
a dozen new experiences you've mentioned already. If you go on like this
always, you'll know everything in time."</p>

<p>"I hope so!" Beth muttered. "Fell acquainted with you, isn't bad; but I
wonder if <i>tumbled</i> wouldn't have been better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She dozed off uncomfortably before she could finish the sentence. He had
settled himself with his head against the uncertain cliff, which beetled
above them ominously; but they were both beyond thinking or caring about
it. Vaguely conscious of each other, and of the sea-voice that gradually
grew distant and more distant as the water went out beyond the headland,
leaving them stranded in the empty cove, they rested and slept uneasily,
yet heavily enough to know little of the weary while they had to wait
before they could make their escape.</p>

<p>For it was not until the sun had set and the moon hung high above the
sea in a sombre sky, that at last they were able to go.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was dark night when Beth got back to the
 little house in Orchard
Street. She had hoped to slip in unobserved, but her mother was looking
out for her.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" she demanded angrily.</p>

<p>Beth had come in prepared to tell the whole exciting story, but this
reception irritated her, and she answered her mother in exactly the same
tone: "I've been at Fairholm."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing there?" Mrs. Caldwell snapped.</p>

<p>"Getting myself into a mess, as any one might see who looked at me,"
Beth rejoined. "I must go and change."</p>

<p>"You can go to bed," said her mother.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," said Beth, and went off straight away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell would have liked to have followed her, and given her a
good beating, as in the old days, had she dared. Her harshness, however,
had much the same effect upon Beth that a beating used to have; it shut
her up in herself, and deprived her of the power to take her mother into
her confidence.</p>

<p>Harriet followed her to her room. "Whativer 'ave you been doin'?" she
exclaimed. "You're draggled from top to toe, and your Sunday dress too!"</p>

<p>"I got caught by the tide," said Beth; "and I'm done."</p>

<p>"Just you get into bed, then," said Harriet; "and I'll fetch you up some
tea when she goes out. She's off in a moment to Lady Benyon's."</p>

<p>"Bless you, Harriet!" Beth exclaimed. "I read in a book once that there
is no crime but has some time been a virtue, and I am sure it will be a
virtue to steal me some tea on this occasion, if it ever is."</p>

<p>"Oh, all's fair in love and war," Harriet answered cheerfully, as she
helped Beth off with her boots; "and you and yer ma's at war again, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Seems like it," Beth sighed. "But stay, though. No, you mustn't steal
the tea. I promised Aunt Victoria. And that reminds me. There's some
still left in her little canister. Here, take it and make it, and have
some yourself as a reward for the trouble. Hot tea and toast, an you
love me, Harriet, and to save my life. I've had nothing but salt water
since breakfast."</p>

<p>When Beth went downstairs next morning, her mother scowled at her. "What
did you mean by telling me you had been at Fairholm yesterday?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I meant to tell you where I had been," Beth answered impertinently.</p>

<p>"I saw your Aunt Grace Mary last night, and she told me she had not seen
you."</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Grace Mary is a good size," Beth rejoined, "but she doesn't
cover the whole estate."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell flushed angrily. "You're an ill-conditioned girl, and will
come to a bad end, or I'm much mistaken," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"With the help of my relations, it's likely," Beth retorted.</p>

<p>Her mother said no more until breakfast was over, and then she ordered
her peremptorily to get out her lessons.</p>

<p>"Oh, lessons!" Beth grumbled. "What's the use of the kind of lessons <i>I</i>
do? I'm none the better for knowing that Henry VIII. had six wives, nor
the happier, nor the richer; and my wit and wisdom certainly don't
increase, nor my manners improve, if you speak the truth."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell changed countenance. If Beth rebelled against the
home-teaching, what would happen about the money that Jim was enjoying?
Upon reflection, her mother saw she was making a mistake.</p>

<p>"I think," she began in a conciliatory tone, "you are right perhaps. You
had better not do any lessons this morning, for I am sure you cannot be
well, Beth, or you would never speak to your mother in such a way."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry, mamma," Beth rejoined in a mollified tone. "But you
know I cannot stand these everlasting naggings and scoldings. They make
me horrid. I'm pugnacious when I'm rubbed the wrong way; I can't help
it."</p>

<p>"There, there, then; that will do," Mrs. Caldwell replied. "Run out and
amuse yourself, or have a rest. You take too much exercise, and tire
yourself to death; and then you are <i>so</i> cross there is no speaking to
you. Go away, like a good child, and amuse yourself until you feel
better."</p>

<p>Beth went back to her own room at once, only too glad to escape and be
alone. She was not well. Every bone in her body ached, and her head was
thumping so she had to lie down on her bed at last, and keep still for
the rest of the day. But her mind was active the whole time, and it was
a happy day. She expected nothing, yet she was pleasurably satisfied,
perfectly content.</p>

<p>The next morning at eleven there was service in the church at the end of
the road. Beth and her mother had been having the usual morning misery
at lessons, and both were exhausted when the bell began to ring. Beth's
countenance was set sullen, and Mrs. Caldwell's showed suppressed
irritation. The bell was a relief to them.</p>

<p>"Can I go to church?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>Her mother's first impulse was to say no, out of pure contrariness; but
the chance of getting rid of Beth on any honourable pretext was too much
of a temptation even for her to withstand. "Yes, if you like," she
answered ungraciously, after a moment's hesitation; "and get some good
out of it if you can," she added sarcastically.</p>

<p>Beth went with honest intention. There was a glow in her chest which
added fervency to her devotions, and when Alfred entered from the vestry
and took his seat in the chancel pew, happiness, tingling in every
nerve, suffused her. His first glance was for her, and Beth knew it, but
bent her head. Her soul did magnify the Lord, however, and her spirit
did rejoice in God her Saviour, with unlimited love and trust. He had
saved them, He would hear them. He would help them, He would make them
both&mdash;<i>both</i> good and great&mdash;great after a pause, as being perhaps not a
worthy aspiration.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not look at Alfred a second time, but she sat and stood and
knelt, all conscious of him, and it seemed as if the service lasted but
a moment.</p>

<p>Directly it was over, she fled, taking the narrow path by the side of
the church to the fields; but before she was half way across the first
field, she heard a quick step following her. Beth felt she must stop
short&mdash;or run; she began to run.</p>

<p>"Beth! Beth! wait for me," he called.</p>

<p>Beth stopped, then turned to greet him shyly; but when he came close,
and put his arm round her, she looked up smiling. They gazed into each
other's eyes a moment, and then kissed awkwardly, like children.</p>

<p>"Were you any the worse for our adventure?" he asked. "I've been longing
to know."</p>

<p>"I had a headache yesterday," said Beth. "How were you?"</p>

<p>"All stiff and aching," he replied, "or I should have been to ask after
you."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't come," Beth ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Why? I ought to know your people, you know. Why don't the Richardsons
know them?"</p>

<p>"Because we're poor," Beth answered bluntly; "and Mr. Richardson
neglects his poor parishioners."</p>

<p>"All the more reason that I should call," Alfred Cayley Pounce
persisted. "You are people of good family like ourselves, and old Rich
is a nobody."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Beth; "but my mother would not let me know you. She and I
are always&mdash;always&mdash;we never agree, you know. I don't think we can help
it; we certainly don't do it on purpose&mdash;at least <i>I</i> don't; but there's
something in us that makes us jar about everything. I was going to tell
her all about you on Sunday night; but when I got in I couldn't. She
began by being angry because I was late, without waiting to know if I
were to blame, and that&mdash;that shut me up, and I never told her; and now
I don't think I could."</p>

<p>"But what objection can she have to me?" he asked loftily. "I really
must make her acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Not through me, then," said Beth. "Do you know the Benyons?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know anybody in the neighbourhood as yet. I'm here with old
Rich to be crammed. My people are trying to force me into the bar or the
church or something, because I want to be a sculptor."</p>

<p>"Don't be forced," said Beth with spirit. "Follow your own bent. I mean
to follow mine."</p>

<p>"I didn't know girls had any bent," he answered dubiously.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a recoil in Beth. "How is it people never expect a girl to do
anything?" she exclaimed, firing up.</p>

<p>"I don't see what a girl can do," he rejoined, "except marry and look
after her husband and children."</p>

<p>"That's all right at the proper time," Beth said. "But meanwhile, and if
she doesn't marry, is she to do nothing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are always lots of little things a woman can do," he answered
airily.</p>

<p>"But supposing little things don't satisfy her, and she has power to
follow some big pursuit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, in that case," he began, somewhat superciliously. "But it's
too rare to be taken into account&mdash;talent in women."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Beth said. "Robbing women of the means to develop
their talents doesn't prove they haven't any. The best horseman in the
world could never have ridden if he hadn't had a horse. I certainly
think a woman should see to the ordering of her household; but if she
has it in her to do more why shouldn't she? <i>I</i> shall want to do more, I
know. I shall want to be something; and I shall never believe that I
cannot be that something until I have tried the experiment. If you have
it in you to be a sculptor, be a sculptor. <i>I</i> certainly should, girl
and all as I am. I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"You're very valiant!" he said drily; "but you don't know what it is to
have your whole family against you."</p>

<p>"Don't I?" said Beth, laughing. "I've known that all my life; but I've
known something besides. I've known what it is to be myself. If you know
yourself, and yourself is a sculptor, you're bound to be a sculptor in
spite of your family."</p>

<p>He looked at her admiringly. "When you talk like that, I feel I could be
anything or do anything that you like, I love you so," he ventured,
flipping the grass with his stick to cover his boyish embarrassment. "I
am thinking of you always, all day long."</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange!" Beth answered softly. "And only two days ago we had
never met!"</p>

<p>"But now we shall never part," he said. "Only I don't want you to be
anything, or to care to be anything, but just my wife."</p>

<p>The word wife came upon Beth with the shock of a sweet surprise. She had
not realised that she would ever be asked to be any one's wife; that
seemed something reserved for the honour of beings above her, beautiful
beings in books; and the hot flush of joy that suffused her at the word
rendered her oblivious to the condition attached. She looked up in the
young man's face with eyes full of love and gratitude, her transparent
skin bright with a delicate blush, and her lips just parted in a smile.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> sweet, Beth!" he exclaimed. "How sweet you are!"</p>

<p>For the next few weeks they saw each other every day, if it were only
for a few minutes; but even when they contrived to spend long hours
together it was not enough. Beth scarcely ate or slept at that time; the
glow and spring and flood of feeling that coursed through her whole
being sustained her.</p>

<p>"When we are married we shall always be together," Alfred would whisper
when they had to separate; and then their eyes would dilate with joy at
the heavenly prospect; each was covered the while with smiles and
confusion neither of which they could control. They made each other no
formal vows. It was all taken for granted between them. Now they were
engaged; but when they were old enough, and had an income, they were to
be married.</p>

<p>Alfred had given up the idea of making Mrs. Caldwell's acquaintance
before it was absolutely necessary. For the present, it delighted them
to think that their secret was all their own, and no one suspected it,
except Dicksie, the vicar's hunchback son, whom Alfred had taken into
his confidence. Dicksie was as old as Alfred, but his deformity had
stunted his growth, and the young lovers, looking down into his pathetic
face, were filled with compassion, and eagerly anxious to make atonement
to him for his misfortune by sharing as much of their happiness with him
as might be. They encouraged him to accompany them in their walks when
he could, which was a joy to him, for he was content to live upon the
fringe of their romance unselfishly. When they separated, Beth and
Alfred kissed each other frankly, and then Beth would stoop and kiss
Dicksie also, in pure affection.</p>

<p>Neither of the three troubled themselves about other people in those
days, and they never suspected that their own doings could be of
consequence to anybody. They therefore remained serenely unaware of the
fact that the whole place was talking about them, their own relations
being the only people who did not know of the intimacy; and, worse
still, everybody objected to it. All the forces of Nature combined, and
the vast scheme of the universe itself had been ordered so as to unite
those two young things; but, on the other hand, the whole machinery of
civilisation was set in readiness to keep them apart. And the first
intimation they had of this fact took them by surprise.</p>

<p>The whole happy summer had passed, and autumn was with them, mellow,
warm, and still. The days were shorter then, and the young people
delighted to slip out at dusk, and wander about the fields, all three
together. A gate opened from the vicarage grounds into the field-path
beside the church, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
 there Alfred and Dicksie waited till Beth
appeared, and often waited in vain, for Beth could not always get out.
Her mother told Lady Benyon that Beth was tiresome rather than naughty
in those days. She seemed to have no idea of time. She would stay out so
late that her mother became quite fidgety about her, not knowing what
had become of her; and when Beth came in at last in a casual way,
beaming blandly at every one, it was certainly provoking. Beth thought
her mother unreasonable to object to her late rambles. She was not
giving her any trouble; and she could not understand why her mother was
not content to let her be happy in her own way.</p>

<p>Beth's lessons became more perfunctory than ever that summer. Mrs.
Caldwell salved her own conscience on the subject by arguing that it is
not wise to teach a girl too much when she is growing so fast, and Lady
Benyon agreed. Lady Benyon had no patience with people who over-educate
girls&mdash;with boys it was different; but let a girl grow up strong and
healthy, and get her married as soon as possible, was what she advised.
Had any one asked what was to become of a girl brought up for that
purpose solely, if no one were found to marry her, Lady Benyon would
have disposed of the question with a shrug of the shoulders. She laid
down the principle, and if it did not act, somebody must be to blame.
The principle itself was good, she was sure of that. So Beth was kept
without intellectual discipline to curb her senses at this critical
period, and the consequence was that her energy took the form of
sensuous rather than intellectual pursuits. Her time was devoted not to
practising, but to playing; to poetry, and to dreamy musings. She wove
words to music at the piano by the hour together, lolled about in
languorous attitudes, was more painfully concerned than ever about her
personal adornment, delighted in scents and in luxurious imaginings, and
altogether fed her feelings to such excess, that if her moral nature
were not actually weakened, it was certainly endangered.</p>

<p>Fortunately she had an admirable companion in Alfred. The boy is not
naturally like a beast, unable to restrain his passions, a bit more than
the girl. To men as to women the power to control themselves comes of
the determination. There are cases of natural depravity, of course, but
they are not peculiar to either sex; and as the girl may inherit the
father's vices, so may the boy have his mother to thank for his virtues.
Depravity is oftener acquired than inherited. As a rule, the girl's
surroundings safeguard her from the acquisition; but when they do not,
she becomes as bad as the boy. The boy, on the contrary, especially if
he is sent to a public school, is systematically trained to be vicious.
He learns the Latin grammar from his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
 masters, and from the habitual
conversation of the other boys, the books secretly circulated by them,
and their traditional code of vice, he becomes familiarised with the
most hoggish habits. He may escape the practical initiation by a miracle
at the time; but it is from the mind familiar with ideas of vice that
the vicious impulse eventually springs; and the seed of corruption once
sown in it, bears fruit almost inevitably.</p>

<p>Alfred had escaped this contamination by being kept at home at a
day-school, and when Beth knew him he was as refined and high-minded as
he was virile for his age, and as self-restrained as she was impetuous.
She wanted to hurry on, and shape their lives; but he was content to let
things come about. She lived in the future, he in the present; and he
was teaching her to do the same, which was an excellent thing for her.
Often when she was making plans he would check her by saying, "Aren't
you satisfied? I can't imagine myself happier than I am at this moment."</p>

<p>One thing neither of them ever anticipated, and that was interference.
They expected those happy days to last without interruption until the
happier ones came, when they should be independent, and could do as they
liked.</p>

<p>"When I am king, diddle, diddle, you shall be queen," Alfred used to
sing to Beth; "and Dicksie shall be prime minister."</p>

<p>One night they were out in the fields together. Beth was sitting on a
rail, with her arm round Dicksie's neck, as he stood on one side of her;
Alfred being on the other, with his arm round her, supporting her. They
were talking about flowers. Alfred was great on growing flowers. The
vicar had given him a piece of the vicarage garden for his own, and he
was going to build a little green-house to keep Beth well supplied with
bouquets. They were deeply engrossed in the subject, and the night was
exceedingly dark, so that they did not notice a sailor creep stealthily
up the field behind them on the other side of the hedge, and crouch down
near enough to hear all that they said. Certainly that sailor was never
more at sea in his life than he was while he listened to their innocent
prattle.</p>

<p>When at last Beth said it was time to go home, and they strolled away
arm in arm, Alfred and Dicksie discovered that they were late, and Beth
insisted on parting from them at the field-gate into the vicarage
grounds instead of letting them see her safe into the street. When they
left her, she hurried on down the path beside the church alone, and she
had not taken many steps before she was suddenly confronted by a tall
dark man, who made as if he would not let her pass. She stopped
startled, and then went straight up to him boldly and peered into his
face.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that you, Gard?" she exclaimed. "How dare you!"</p>

<p>"How dare you!" he rejoined impudently. "I've had my eye on you for some
time. I saw you out there just now in the field. I was determined to
know what you were up to. There's mighty little happens here that I
don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Beth, "so you're the town spy, are you? Well, you're not
going to spy upon me, so I warn you, Mr. Gard. The next time I come
here, I'll come armed, and if I catch you dogging me about again, I'll
shoot you as dead as my father's pistols can do it. And as it is, you
shall pay for this, I promise you. Just step aside now, you cowardly
black devil, and let me pass. Do you think that it's milk I've got in my
veins that you come out on a fool's errand to frighten me?"</p>

<p>Without a word the man stepped aside, and Beth walked on down the path
with her head in the air, and deliberately, to let him see how little
she feared him.</p>

<p>The next morning, directly after breakfast, she went down to the pier.
Count Bartahlinsky's yacht was alongside, and Gard was on deck. He
changed countenance when Beth appeared. She ran down the ladder.</p>

<p>"I want to see your master," she said.</p>

<p>"He can't see you, miss. He's given orders that he's not to be disturbed
for no one whatsoever," Gard answered with excess of deference; "and
it's as much as my billet is worth to go near him; he's very much
occupied this morning."</p>

<p>"Don't tell lies," said Beth. "I'm going to see him."</p>

<p>She went forward to the skylight as she spoke, and called down, "Below
there, Count Gustav!"</p>

<p>"Hello!" a voice replied. "Is that you, Beth? You know you're too big to
be on the yacht now without a chaperon."</p>

<p>"Rot!" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Don't be coarse, Beth," Count Gustav remonstrated from below in rather
a precious tone. "You know how I dislike hoyden English."</p>

<p>"Well, then, <i>nonsense</i>! if that's any better," Beth rejoined. "You've
got to see me&mdash;this once at all events, or there'll be a tragedy."</p>

<p>"Oh, in that case," was the resigned reply, "I'll come on deck."</p>

<p>Beth walked aft and waited for him, enthroned on the bulwark, with a
coil of rope for her footstool.</p>

<p>When Count Gustav appeared, he looked at her quizzically. "What is the
matter, Beth?" he asked. "What are you boiling with indignation about
now?"</p>

<p>"About that man Gard," Beth replied. "What do you think he was doing
last night? and not for the first time, by his own account. Spying!"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Spying!" said Bartahlinsky. "Gard, come here."</p>

<p>Gard, who had been anxiously watching them from amidships, approached.</p>

<p>"Now, Beth, what do you mean?" said the Count.</p>

<p>"I mean that I was out sitting on a rail in the church-fields last night
with Alfred Cayley Pounce and Dicksie Richardson talking, and this man
came and listened; and then when I left them, he met me on the path
beside the church, and spoke impudently to me, and would not let me
pass. I know what you thought," she broke out, turning upon Gard. "You
thought I was doing something that I was ashamed of, and you'd find it
out, and have me in your power. But I'll have you know that I do nothing
I'm ashamed of&mdash;nothing I should be ashamed to tell your master about,
so you may save yourself the trouble of spying upon me, Black Gard, as
they well call you."</p>

<p>Gard was about to say something, but Count Gustav stopped him
peremptorily. "You can go," he said. "I'll hear what you have to say
later."</p>

<p>Then he sat down beside Beth, and talked to her long and earnestly. He
advised her to give up her rambles with Alfred and Dicksie; but she
assured him that that was impossible.</p>

<p>"Who else have I?" she asked pathetically. "And what am I to do with my
days if they never come into them again?"</p>

<p>"You ought to have been sent to school, Beth, long ago, and I told your
mother so," Count Gustav answered, frowning. "And, by Jove, I'll tell
her again," he thought, "before it's too late."</p>

<p>The encounter with Gard added excitement to the charm of Beth's next
meeting with the boys. It made them all feel rather important. They
discussed it incessantly, speculating as to what the man's object could
have been. Alfred said vulgar curiosity; but Beth suspected that there
was more than that in the man&oelig;uvre; and when Dicksie suggested
acutely that Gard had intended to blackmail them, she and Alfred both
exclaimed that that was it!</p>

<p>They had gone about together all this time in the most open way; now
they began to talk about caution and concealment, like the persecuted
lovers of old romance, who had powerful enemies, and were obliged to
manage their meetings so that they should not be suspected. They decided
not to speak to each other in public, and, consequently, when they met
in the street, they passed with such an elaborate parade of ignoring
each other, and yet with such evident enjoyment of the position, that
people began to wonder what on earth they were up to. Disguises would
have delighted them; but the fashions of the day did not lend themselves
much to disguise, unfortunately. There were no masks, no sombreros, no
cloaks; and all they could think of was

 false whiskers for Alfred; but
when he tried them, they altered him so effectually that Dicksie said he
could not bear him, and Beth would not kiss him.</p>

<p>One evening after dinner, when Mrs. Caldwell was reading aloud to Beth
and Bernadine, there came a thundering knock at the front door, which
startled them all. The weather had been bad all day, and now the
shutters were closed, the rain beat against them with a chilly,
depressing effect, inexpressibly dreary. Instead of attending to the
reading, Beth had been listening to the footsteps of people passing in
the street, in the forlorn hope that among them she might distinguish
Alfred's. When the knock came they thought it was a runaway, but Harriet
opened the door all the same, and presently returned, smiling archly,
and holding aloft a beautiful bouquet.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said Mrs. Caldwell. "Give it to me."</p>

<p>Beth's heart stood still.</p>

<p>There was a card attached to the flowers, and Mrs. Caldwell read aloud,
"<i>Miss Caldwell, with respectful compliments.</i>"</p>

<p>"Who brought this, Harriet?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No one, ma'am," Harriet replied. "It was 'itched on till the knocker."</p>

<p>"Very strange," Mrs. Caldwell muttered suspiciously. "Beth, do you know
anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Is there no name on the card?" Beth asked diplomatically; and Mrs.
Caldwell looked at the card instead of into Beth's face, and discovered
nothing.</p>

<p>Raindrops sparkled on the flowers, their fragrance filled the room, and
their colours and forms and freshness were a joy to behold. "How
beautiful they are!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>"May I have them, mamma?" Beth put in quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I suppose you may," Mrs. Caldwell decided; "although I must
say I do not understand their being left in this way at all. Who could
have sent you flowers?"</p>

<p>"There's the gardener at Fairholm," Beth ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>"Oh, ah, yes," said Mrs. Caldwell, handing the flowers to Beth without
further demur. The gift appeared less lovely, somehow, when she began to
associate it with the gardener's respectful compliments.</p>

<p>Beth took the flowers, and hid her burning face with them. This was her
first bouquet, the most exquisite thing that had ever happened to her.
She carried it off to her room, and put it in water; and when she went
to bed she kept the candle burning that she might lie and look at it.</p>

<p>The following week a menagerie came to the place. Alfred and Dicksie
went to it, and their description filled Beth with a wild desire to see
the creatures, especially the chimpanzee. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
 boys were quite ready to
take her, but how was it to be managed? The menagerie was only to be
there that one night more, but it would be open late, and they would be
allowed to go because animals are improving. Could she get out too? Beth
considered intently.</p>

<p>"I can go to bed early," she said at last, "and get out by the
acting-room window."</p>

<p>"But suppose you were missed?" Alfred deprecated.</p>

<p>"Then I should be found out," said Beth; "but you would not."</p>

<p>"How about being recognised in the menagerie, though?" said Dicksie.
"You see there'll be lots of people, and it's all lighted up."</p>

<p>"I can disguise myself to look like an old woman," Beth rejoined,
thinking of Aunt Victoria's auburn front and some of her old things.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Beth!" Alfred protested. "That would be worse than the
whiskers."</p>

<p>"Can't you come as a boy?" said Dicksie.</p>

<p>"I believe I can," Beth exclaimed. "There's an old suit of Jim's
somewhere that would be the very thing&mdash;one he grew out of. I believe
it's about my size, and I think I know where it is. What a splendid
idea, Dicksie! I can cut my hair off."</p>

<p>"Oh no! Your pretty hair!" Alfred exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Is it pretty?" said Beth, surprised and pleased.</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> it pretty!" he ejaculated, lifting it with both hands, and bathing
his face in it; "the brightest, brownest, curliest, softest, sweetest
hair on earth! Turn it up under your cap. These little curls on your
neck will look like short hair."</p>

<p>They were all so delighted with this romantic plan, that they danced
about, and hugged each other promiscuously. But this last piece of
cleverness was their undoing, for Beth was promptly recognised at the
menagerie by some one with a sense of humour, who told Lady Benyon, who
told Mrs. Caldwell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell came hurrying home from Lady Benyon's a few nights later
with the queerest expression of countenance Beth had ever seen; it was
something between laughing and crying.</p>

<p>"Beth," she began in an agitated manner, "I am told that you went with
two of Mr. Richardson's sons to the menagerie on Tuesday night, dressed
as a boy."</p>

<p>"<i>One</i> of his sons," said Beth, correcting her; "the other boy was his
pupil."</p>

<p>"And you were walking about looking at the animals in that public place
with your arm round the girl from the shoe-shop?"</p>

<p>Beth burst out laughing. "All the boys had their arms round girls," she
explained. "I couldn't be singular."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell dropped into a chair, and sat gazing at Beth as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> if she
had never seen anything like her before, as indeed she never had.</p>

<p>"Who is this pupil of Mr. Richardson's?" she asked at last, "and how did
you make his acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"His name is Alfred Cayley Pounce," Beth answered. "We were caught by
the tide and nearly drowned together on the sands, and I've known him
ever since."</p>

<p>"And do you mean to say that you have been meeting this young man in a
clandestine manner&mdash;that you hadn't the proper pride to refuse to
associate with him unless he were known to your family and you could
meet him as an equal?"</p>

<p>"He did wish to make your acquaintance, but I wouldn't let him," Beth
said.</p>

<p>"Why?" Mrs. Caldwell asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, because I was afraid you would be horrid to him," Beth answered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell was thunderstruck. The whole affair had overwhelmed her as
a calamity which could not be met by any ordinary means. Scolding was
out of the question, for she was not able to utter another word, but
just sat there with such a miserable face, she might have been the
culprit herself, especially as she ended by bursting into tears.</p>

<p>Beth's heart smote her, and she watched her mother for some time,
yearning to say something to comfort her.</p>

<p>"I don't think you need be so distressed, mamma," she ventured at last
"What have I done, after all? I've committed no crime."</p>

<p>"You've done just about as bad a thing as you could do," Mrs. Caldwell
rejoined. "You've made the whole place talk about you. You must have
known you were doing wrong. But I think you can have no conscience at
all."</p>

<p>"I think I have a conscience, only it doesn't always act," Beth answered
disconsolately. "Very often, when I am doing a wrong thing, it doesn't
accuse me; when it does, I stop and repent."</p>

<p>She was sitting beside the dining-table, balancing a pencil on her
finger as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Look at you now, Beth," her mother ejaculated, "utterly callous!"</p>

<p>Beth sighed, and put the pencil down. She despaired of ever making her
mother understand anything, and determined not to try again.</p>

<p>"Beth, I don't know what to do with you," Mrs. Caldwell recommenced
after a long silence. "I've been warned again and again that I should
have trouble with you, and Heaven knows I have. You've done a monstrous
thing, and, instead of being terrified

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
 when you're found out, you sit
there coolly discussing it, as if you were a grown-up person. And then
you're so queer. You ought to be a child, but you're not. Lady Benyon
likes you; but even she says you're not a child, and never were. You say
things no sane child would ever think of, and very few grown-up people.
You are <i>not</i> like other people, there's no denying it."</p>

<p>Beth's eyes filled with tears. To be thought unlike other people was the
one thing that made her quail.</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, what am I to do?" she said. "I hate to vex you, goodness
knows; but I must be doing something. The days are long and dreary." She
wiped her eyes. "When people warned you that you would have trouble with
me, they always said unless you sent me to school."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell rocked herself on her chair forlornly. "School would do
you no good," she declared at last. "No, Beth, you are my cross, and I
must bear it. If I forgive you again this time, will you be a better
girl in future?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it's my fault that I ever annoy you," Beth answered
drily.</p>

<p>"Whose fault is it, then?" her mother demanded.</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders and began to balance the pencil on her
fingers once more.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell got up and stood looking at her for a little with a
gathering expression of dislike on her face which it was not good to
see; then she went towards the door.</p>

<p>"You are incorrigible," she ejaculated as she opened it, making the
remark to cover her retreat.</p>

<p>Beth sighed heavily, then resolved herself into a Christian martyr,
cruelly misjudged&mdash;an idea which she pursued with much satisfaction to
herself for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>In consequence of that conversation with her mother, when the evening
came her conscience accused her, and she made no attempt to go out. She
was to meet Alfred and Dicksie on Saturday, their next half-holiday, and
she would wait till then. That was Wednesday.</p>

<p>During the interval, however, a strange chill came over her feelings.
The thought of Alfred was as incessant as ever, but it came without the
glow of delight; something was wrong.</p>

<p>They were to meet on the rocks behind the far pier at low water on
Saturday. Few people came to the far pier, and, when they did, it was
seldom that they looked over; and they could not have seen much if they
had, for the rocks were brown with seaweed, and dark figures wandering
about on them became indistinguishable. Beth went long before the time.
It was a beautiful still grey day, such as she loved, and she longed to
be alone with the sea. The tide was going out, and she had a fancy

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> for
following it from rock to rock as it went. Some of the bigger rocks were
flat-topped islands, separated from the last halting-place of the tide
by narrow straits, across which she sprang; and on these she would lie
her length, peering down into the clear depths on the farther side,
where the healthy happy sea-creatures disported themselves, and seaweeds
of wondrous colours waved in fantastic forms. The water lapped up and up
and up the rocks, rising with a sobbing sound, and bringing fresh airs
with it that fanned her face, and caused her to draw in her breath
involuntarily, and inhale long deep draughts with delight. As the water
went out, bright runnels were left where rivers had been, and miniature
bays became sheltered coves, paved with polished pebbles or purple
mussels, and every little sandy space was ribbed with solid waves where
the busy lob-worms soon began to send up their ropy castings. Beyond the
break of the water the silver sea sloped up to the horizon, and on it,
rocking gently, far out, a few cobles were scattered, with rich red
sails all set ready, waiting for a breeze. It was an exquisite scene,
remote from all wail of human feeling, and strangely tranquillising.
Gradually it gained upon Beth. Her bosom heaved with the heaving water
rhythmically, and she lost herself in contemplation of sea and sky
scape. Before she had been many minutes prone upon the farthest rock,
the vision and the dream were upon her. That other self of hers unfurled
its wings, and she floated off, revelling in an ecstasy of gentle
motion. Beyond the sea-line were palaces with terraced gardens, white
palaces against which grass and trees showed glossy green; and there she
wandered among the flowers, and waited. She was waiting for something
that did not happen, for some one who did not come.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat up on her rock. The sun was sinking behind her, the
silver sea shone iridescent, the tide had turned. But where were the
boys? She looked about her. Out on the sands beyond the rocks on her
right, a man was wading in the water with a net, shrimping. Close at
hand another was gathering mussels for bait, and a gentleman was walking
towards her over the slippery rocks, balancing himself as though he
found it difficult to keep his feet; but these were the only people in
sight. The gentleman was a stranger. He wore a dark-blue suit, with a
shirt of wonderful whiteness, and Beth could not help noticing how
altogether well-dressed he was&mdash;too well-dressed for climbing on the
rocks. She noticed his dress particularly, because well-dressed men were
rare in Rainharbour. He was tall, with glossy black hair inclining to
curl, slight whiskers and moustache, blue eyes, and a bright complexion.
A woman with as much colour would have been accused of painting; in him
it gave to some

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
 people the idea of superabundant health, to others it
suggested a phthisical tendency. Beth looked at him as he approached as
she looked at everybody and everything with interest&mdash;nothing escaped
her; but he made no great impression upon her. She thought of him
principally as a man with a watch; and when he was near enough she asked
him what time it was. He told her, looking hard at her, and smiling
pleasantly as he returned his watch to his pocket. She noticed that his
teeth were good, but too far apart, a defect which struck her as
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Why, it is quite late!" she exclaimed, forgetting to thank him in her
surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you all alone here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was waiting for some friends," she answered, "but they have not come.
They must have been detained."</p>

<p>She began to walk back as she spoke, and the gentleman turned too
perforce, for the tide was close upon them.</p>

<p>"Let me help you," he said, holding out his hand, which was noticeably
white and well-shaped; "the rocks are rough and slippery."</p>

<p>"I can manage, thank you," Beth answered. "I am accustomed to them."</p>

<p>Beth involuntarily resolved herself into a young lady the moment she
addressed this man, and spoke now with the self-possession of one
accustomed to courtesies. Even at that age her soft cultivated voice and
easy assurance of manner, and above all her laugh, which was not the
silvery laugh of fiction, but the soundless laugh of good society,
marked the class to which she belonged; and as he stumbled along beside
her, her new acquaintance wondered how it happened that she was at once
so well-bred and so shabbily dressed. He began to question her
guardedly.</p>

<p>"Do you know Rainharbour well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I live here," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose you know every one in the place," he pursued.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she rejoined. "I know very few people, except my own, of
course."</p>

<p>"Which is considered the principal family here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Benyon family is the biggest and the wickedest, I should think,"
she answered casually.</p>

<p>"But I meant the most important," he explained, smiling.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "Uncle James Patten thinks that next to
himself the Benyons are. He married one of them. He's an awful snob."</p>

<p>"And what is his position?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;he's a landowner; that's his estate over there," and she
nodded towards Fairholm.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! How far does it extend?"</p>

<p>"From the sea right up to the hills there, and a little way beyond."</p>

<p>They had left the rocks by this time, and were toiling up the steep road
into the town. When they reached the top, Beth exclaimed abruptly, "I am
late! I must fly!" and leaving her companion without further ceremony,
turned down a side street and ran home.</p>

<p>When she got in, she wondered what had become of Alfred and Dicksie, and
she was conscious of a curious sort of suspense, which, however, did not
amount to anxiety. It was as if she were waiting and listening for
something she expected to hear, which would explain in words what she
held already inarticulate in some secret recess of her being&mdash;held in
suspense and felt, but had not yet apprehended in the region of thought.
There are people who collect and hold in themselves some knowledge of
contemporary events as the air collects and holds moisture; it may be
that we all do, but only one here and there becomes aware of the fact.
As the impalpable moisture in the air changes to palpable rain so does
this vague cognisance become a comprehensible revelation by being
resolved into a shower of words on occasion by some process psychically
analogous to the condensation of moisture in the air. It is a natural
phenomenon known to babes like Beth, but ill-observed, and not at all
explained, because man has gone such a little way beyond the bogey of
the supernatural in psychical matters that he is still befogged, and
makes up opinions on the subject like a divine when miracles are in
question, instead of searching for information like an honest
philosopher, whose glory it is, not to prove himself right, but to
discover the truth.</p>

<p>Beth did not sleep much that night. She recalled the sigh and sob and
freshness of the sea, and caught her breath again as if the cool water
were still washing up and up and up towards her. She saw the silver
surface, too, stretching on to those shining palaces, where grass and
tree showed vivid green against white walls, and flowers stood still on
airless terraces, shedding strange perfumes. And she also saw her new
acquaintance coming towards her, balancing himself on the slippery,
wrack-grown rocks, in boots and things that were much too good for the
purpose; but Alfred and Dicksie never appeared, and were not to be found
of her imagination. They were nowhere.</p>

<p>She expected to see them in church next day&mdash;at least, so she assured
herself, and then was surprised to find that there was no sort of
certainty in herself behind the assurance, although they had always
hitherto been in church. "Something is different,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> somehow," she
thought, and the phrase became a kind of accompaniment to all her
thoughts.</p>

<p>Dicksie was the first person she saw when she entered the church, but
Alfred was not there, and he did not come. She went up the field-path
after the service, and waited about for Dicksie. When Alfred was
detained himself, Dicksie usually came to explain; but that day he did
not appear, and they were neither of them at the evening service. Beth
could not understand it, but she was more puzzled than perturbed.</p>

<p>She was reading French to her mother next morning by way of a lesson,
when they both happened to look up and see Mrs. Richardson, the vicar's
worn-out wife, passing the window. The next moment there was a knock at
the door.</p>

<p>"Can she be coming here?" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What should she come here for?" Beth rejoined, her heart palpitating.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear! this is just what I expected!" Mrs. Caldwell
declared. "And if only she had come last week, I should have known
nothing about it."</p>

<p>"You don't know much as it is," Beth observed, without, however, seeing
why that should make any difference.</p>

<p>The next moment the vicar's wife was ushered in with a wink by Harriet.
Mrs. Caldwell and Beth both rose to receive her haughtily. She had
entered with assurance, but that left her the moment she faced them, and
she became exceedingly nervous. She was surprised at the ease and grace
of these shabbily-dressed ladies, and the refinement of their
surroundings&mdash;the design of the furniture, the colour of curtains and
carpet, the china, the books, the pictures, all of which bespoke tastes
and habits not common in the parish.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for this intrusion," she began nervously. "I have a
most unpleasant task to perform. My husband requested me to come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why didn't he come himself?" Beth asked blandly. "Why does he make you
do the disagreeable part of his duties?"</p>

<p>The vicar's wife raised her meek eyes and gazed at Beth. She had not
anticipated this sort of reception from poor parishioners, and was
completely nonplussed. She was startled, too, by Beth's last question,
for she belonged to the days of brave unhonoured endurance, when women,
meekly allowing themselves to be classed with children and idiots,
exacted no respect, and received none&mdash;no woman, decent or otherwise,
being safe from insult in the public streets; when they were expected to
do difficult and dirty work for their husbands, such as canvassing at
elections, without acknowledgment, their wit and capacity being traded
upon without scruple to obtain from men the votes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> which they were not
deemed wise and worthy enough to have themselves; the days when they
gave all and received nothing in return, save doles of bread and
contempt, varied by such caresses as a good dog gets when his master is
in the mood. That was the day before woman began to question the wisdom
and goodness of man, his justice and generosity, his right to make a
virtue of wallowing when he chose to wallow, and his disinterestedness
and discretion when he also arrogated to himself the power to order all
things. Mrs. Richardson had no more thought of questioning the beauty of
her husband's decisions than she had thought of questioning the logic
and mercy of her God, and this first flash of the new spirit of inquiry
from Beth's bright wit came upon her with a shock at first&mdash;one of those
shocks to the mind which is as the strength of wine to the exhausted
body, that checks the breath a moment, then rouses and stimulates.</p>

<p>"May I sit down?" she gasped, then dropped into a chair. "He might have
come himself, to be sure," she muttered. "I have more than enough to do
that is disagreeable in my own womanly sphere without being required to
meddle in parish matters."</p>

<p>Yet when her husband had said to her: "It is a very disagreeable
business indeed this. I think I'll get you to go. You'll manage it with
so much more tact than a man," the poor lady, unaccustomed to
compliments, was gratified. Now, however, thanks to Beth, she had been
nearer to making an acute observation than she had ever been in her life
before; she all but perceived that the woman's sphere is never home
exclusively when man can make use of her for his own purposes elsewhere.
The sphere is the stable he ties her up in when he does not want her,
and takes her from again to drag him out of a difficulty, or up to some
distinction, just as it suits himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell and Beth waited for Mrs. Richardson to commit herself, but
gave her no further help.</p>

<p>"The truth is," she recommenced desperately, "we have lost an excellent
pupil. His people have been informed that he was carrying on an intrigue
with a girl in this place, and have taken him away at a moment's
notice."</p>

<p>"And what has that to do with us?" Mrs. Caldwell asked politely.</p>

<p>"The girl is said to be your daughter."</p>

<p>"This is my eldest daughter at home," Mrs. Caldwell answered. "She is
not yet fourteen."</p>

<p>"But she's a very big girl," Mrs. Richardson faltered.</p>

<p>"Who is this person, this pupil you allude to?" Mrs. Caldwell asked
superciliously.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is the son of wealthy Nottingham people."</p>

<p>"Ah! lace manufacturers, I suppose," Mrs. Caldwell rejoined.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;s," Mrs. Richardson acknowledged with reluctance. She associated,
as she was expected to do, with gentlemen who debauched themselves
freely, but would have scorned the acquaintance of a shopman of saintly
life.</p>

<p>"Then certainly not a proper acquaintance for my daughter," Mrs.
Caldwell decided, with the manner of a county lady speaking to a person
whom she knows to be nobody by birth. "Beth, will you be good enough to
tell us what you know of this youth?"</p>

<p>"I was caught by the tide on the sands one day, and he was there, and
helped me; and I always spoke to him afterwards. I thought I ought, for
politeness' sake," Beth answered easily.</p>

<p>"May I ask how that strikes you?" Mrs. Caldwell, turning to Mrs.
Richardson, requested to know, but did not wait for a reply. "It strikes
me," she proceeded, "that your husband's parish must be in an appalling
state of neglect and disorder when slander is so rife that he loses a
good pupil because an act of common politeness, a service rendered by a
youth on the one hand, and acknowledged by a young lady on the other, is
described as an intrigue. But I still fail to see," she pursued
haughtily, "why you should have come to spread this scandal here in my
house."</p>

<p>"Oh," the little woman faltered, "I was to ask if there had been
any&mdash;any presents. But," she added hastily, to save herself from the
wrath which she saw gathering on Mrs. Caldwell's face, "I am sure there
were not. I'm sure you would never bring a breach of promise case&mdash;I'm
sure it has all been a dreadful mistake. If Mr. Richardson wants
anything of this kind done in future, he must do it himself. I
apologise."</p>

<p>She uttered the last word with a gasp.</p>

<p>"Let me show you out," said Beth, and the discomforted lady found
herself ushered into the street without further ceremony.</p>

<p>When Beth returned she found her mother smiling blandly at the result of
her diplomacy. It was probably the first effort of the kind the poor
lady had ever made, and she was so elated by her success that she took
Beth into her confidence, and forgave her outright in order to hob-nob
with her on the subject.</p>

<p>"I think I fenced with her pretty well," she said several times. "A
woman of her class, a country attorney's daughter or something of that
kind, is no match for a woman of mine. I hope, Beth, this will be a
lesson to you, and will teach you to appreciate the superior tact and
discretion of the upper classes."</p>

<p>Beth could not find it in her heart to say a word to check her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> mother's
jubilation; besides, she had played up to her, answering to expectation,
as she was apt to do, with fatal versatility. But she did not feel that
they had come out of the business well. It was as if their honesty had
been bedraggled somehow, and she could not respect her mother for her
triumph; on the contrary, she pitied her. That kind of diplomacy or
tact, the means by which people who have had every advantage impose upon
those who have had no advantages to speak of, did not appeal to Beth as
pleasant, even at fourteen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell put her work away at once, and hurried off to describe the
encounter to Lady Benyon.</p>

<p>"They had not heard of the menagerie affair, I suppose," the old lady
observed, twinkling. "Thanks to yourself, I think you may consider Miss
Beth is well out of <i>that</i> scrape. But take my advice. Get that girl
married the first chance you have. <i>I</i> know girls, and she's one of the
marrying kind. Once she's married, let her mutiny or do anything she
likes. <i>You'll</i> be shut of the responsibility."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> that time forward it was as if Alfred had vanished into space.
Whether he ever attempted to communicate with her, Beth could not tell;
but she received no letter or message. She expected to hear from him
through Dicksie, but it soon became apparent that Dicksie had deserted
her. He came to none of their old haunts, and never looked her way in
church or in the street when they met. She was ashamed to believe it of
him at first, lest some defect in her own nature should have given rise
to the horrid suspicion; but when she could no longer doubt it, she
shrugged her shoulders as at something contemptible, and dismissed him
from her mind. About Alfred she could not be sure. He might have sent
letters and messages that never reached her, and therefore she would not
blame him; but as the thought of him became an ache, she resolutely set
it aside, so that, in a very short time, in that part of her
consciousness where his image had been, there was a blank. Thus the
whole incident ended like a light extinguished, as Beth acknowledged to
herself at last. "It is curious, though," she thought, "but I certainly
knew it in myself all along from the moment the change came, <i>if only I
could have got at the knowledge</i>."</p>

<p>As a direct result of her separation from Alfred, Beth entered upon a
bad phase. The simple satisfaction of her heart in his company had kept
her sane and healthy. With such a will as hers, it had not been hard to
cast him out of her anticipations;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
 but with him, there went from her
life that wholesome companionship of boy and girl which contains all the
happiness necessary for their immaturity, and also stimulates their
growth in every way by holding out the alluring prospect of the
fulfilment of those hopes of their being towards which their youth
should aspire from the first, insensibly, but without pause. Having once
known this companionship, Beth did not thrive without it. She had no
other interest in its place to take her out of herself, and the time
hung heavy on her hands. With her temperament, however, more than a
momentary pause was impossible. Her active mind, being bare of all
expectation, soon began to sate itself upon vain imaginings. For the
rational plans and pursuits she had been accustomed to make and to carry
out with the boys, she had nothing to substitute but dreams; and on
these she lived, finding an idle distraction in them, until the habit
grew disproportionate, and began to threaten the fine balance of her
other faculties: her reason, her power of accurate observation and of
assimilating every scrap of knowledge that came in her way. To fill up
her empty days, she surrounded herself with a story, among the crowding
incidents of which she lived, whatever she might be doing. She had a
lover who frequented a wonderful dwelling on the other side of the
headland that bounded Rainharbour bay on the north. He was rich, dark,
handsome, a mysterious man, with horses and a yacht. She was his one
thought, but they did not meet often because of their enemies. He was
engaged upon some difficult and dangerous work for the good of mankind,
and she had many a midnight ride to warn him to beware, and many a wild
adventure in an open boat, going out in the dark for news. But there
were happy times too, when they lived together in that handsome house
hidden among the flowers behind the headland, and at night she always
slept with her head on his shoulder. He had a confidential agent, a
doctor, whom he sent to her with letters and messages, because it was
not safe for him to appear in the public streets himself. This man was
just like the one she had met on the rocks, and his clothes were always
too good for the occasion. His name was Angus Ambrose Cleveland.</p>

<p>Just at this time, Charlotte Hardy, the daughter of a doctor who lived
next door to the Benyon Dower House, fell in love with Beth, and began
to make much of her. Beth had never had a girl companion before, and
although she rather looked down on Charlotte, she enjoyed the novelty.
They were about the same age, but Charlotte was smaller than Beth, less
precocious, and better educated. She knew things accurately that Beth
had only an idea of; but Beth could make more use of a hint than
Charlotte could of the fullest information. Beth respected her
knowledge, however, and suffered pangs of humiliation when she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> compared
it to her own ignorance; and it was by way of having something to show
of equal importance that she gradually fell into the habit of confiding
her romance to Charlotte, who listened in perfect good faith to the
fascinating details which Beth poured forth from day to day. Beth did
not at first intend to impose on her credulity; but when she found that
Charlotte in her simplicity believed the whole story, she adapted her
into it, and made her as much a part of it as Hector the hero, and Dr.
Angus Ambrose Cleveland, the confidential agent on whom their safety
depended. Charlotte was Beth's confidante now, a post which had hitherto
been vacant; so the whole machinery of the romance was complete, and in
excellent order.</p>

<p>"It's queer I never see the doctor about," Charlotte said one day, when
they were out on the cliffs together.</p>

<p>Beth happened to look up at that moment and saw her acquaintance of the
rocks coming towards them.</p>

<p>"Your curiosity will be gratified," she said, "for there he is."</p>

<p>"Where?" Charlotte demanded in an excited undertone.</p>

<p>"Approaching," Beth answered calmly.</p>

<p>"Will he speak?" Charlotte asked in a breathless whisper.</p>

<p>"He will doubtless make me a sign," Beth replied.</p>

<p>When he was near enough, the gentleman recognised Beth, and smiled as
they passed each other.</p>

<p>"Oughtn't he to have taken off his hat?" Charlotte asked.</p>

<p>"He means no disrespect," Beth answered with dignity. "It is safer so.
In fact, if you had not been my confidante, he would not have dared to
make any sign at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, then he knows that I am your confidante!" Charlotte exclaimed, much
gratified.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Beth. "I have to keep them informed of all that
concerns me. I brought you here to-day on purpose. I shall doubtless
have to ask you to take letters, and you could not deliver them if you
did not know the doctor by sight. There is the yacht," she added, as a
beautiful white-winged vessel swept round the headland into the bay.</p>

<p>"O Beth! aren't you excited?" Charlotte cried.</p>

<p>"No," Beth answered quietly. "You see I am used to these things."</p>

<p>"Beth, what a strange creature you are," said Charlotte, with respect.
"One can see that there's something extraordinary about you, but one
can't tell what it is. You're not pretty&mdash;at least <i>I</i> don't think so. I
asked papa what he thought, and he said you had your points, and a
something beyond, which is irresistible. He couldn't explain it, though;
but I know what he meant. I always feel it when you talk to me; and I
believe I could die for you. There's Mrs. Warner Benyon out again," she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
broke off to observe. "Papa was called in to see her the other day. He
isn't their doctor, but she was taken ill suddenly, so they sent for him
because he was at hand; and he says her shoulders are like alabaster."</p>

<p>Beth pursed up her mouth at this, but made no answer. When she got home,
however, she repeated the observation to her mother in order to ask her
what alabaster was exactly. Mrs. Caldwell flushed indignantly at the
story. "If Dr. Hardy speaks in that way of his patients to his family,
he won't succeed in his profession," she declared. "A man who talks
about his patients may be a clever doctor, but he's sure not to be a
nice man&mdash;not high-minded, you know&mdash;and certainly not a wise one.
Remember that, Beth, and take my advice: don't have anything to do with
a 'talking doctor'"&mdash;a recommendation which Beth remembered afterwards,
but only to note the futility of warnings.</p>

<p>Matters became very complicated in the story as it proceeded. It was all
due to some Spanish imbroglio, Beth said. Hector ran extraordinary
risks, and she was not too safe herself if things went wrong. There were
implicating documents, and emissaries of the Jesuits were on the
look-out.</p>

<p>One day, Charlotte's mother being away from home, Beth asked her
mysteriously if she could conceal some one in her room at night unknown
to her father.</p>

<p>"Easily," Charlotte answered. "He never comes up to my room."</p>

<p>"Then you must come and ask mamma to let me spend the day and night with
you to-morrow," Beth said. "I shall have business which will keep me
away all day, but I shall return at dusk, and then you must smuggle me
up to your room. We shall be obliged to sit up all night. I don't know
what is going to happen. Are the servants safe? If I should be
betrayed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Safe not to tell you are there," said Charlotte, "and that is all they
will know. They won't tell on me. I never tell on them."</p>

<p>The next morning early, Charlotte arrived in Orchard Street with a face
full of grave importance, and obtained Mrs. Caldwell's consent to take
Beth back with her; but instead of having to go home to spend the day
alone waiting for Beth, as she had expected, she was sent out some
distance along the cliffs to a high hill, which she climbed by Beth's
direction. She was to hide herself among the fir-trees at the top, and
watch for a solitary rider on a big brown horse, who would pass on the
road below between noon and sunset, if all went well, going towards the
headland.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> shall be that rider," Beth said solemnly. "And the moment you see
me, take this blue missive, and place it on the Flat Rock, with a stone
on it to keep it from blowing away;

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
 then go home. If I do not appear
before sunset, here is a red missive to place on the Flat Rock instead
of the blue one, which must then be destroyed by fire. If I return, I
return; if not, never breathe a word of these things to a living soul as
you value your life."</p>

<p>"I would rather die than divulge anything," Charlotte protested
solemnly, and her choice of the word divulge seemed to add considerably
to the dignity of the proceedings.</p>

<p>They separated with a casual nod, that people might not suspect them of
anything important, and each proceeded to act her part in a delightful
state of excitement; but what was thrilling earnest to Charlotte,
calling for courage and endurance, was merely an exhilarating play of
the fancy put into practice to Beth.</p>

<p>By the time Charlotte arrived at the top of the hill, and had settled
herself among the firs overlooking the road below, she was very tired.
Beth had given her a bag, one of Aunt Victoria's many reticules, with
orders not to open it before her watch began. The bag had been a burden
to carry, but Charlotte was repaid for the trouble, for she found it
full of good things to eat, and a bottle of cold coffee and cream to
drink, with lumps of sugar and all complete. Beth had really displayed
the most thoughtful kindness in packing that bag. The contents she had
procured on a sudden impulse from a pastry-cook in the town, by
promising to pay the next time she passed.</p>

<p>After having very much enjoyed a solid Melton Mowbray pie, a sausage in
puff-pastry, a sponge-cake, a lemon cheesecake, and two crisp brandy
snaps, and slowly sipped the coffee, Charlotte felt that this was the
only life worth living, and formally vowed to dedicate herself for ever
to the Secret Service of Humanity&mdash;Beth's name for these enterprises.
She kept a careful eye on the road below all this time, and there ran
through her head the while fragments of a ballad Beth had written, which
added very much to the charm of the occasion.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fir-trees whisper overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Between the living and the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I watch the livelong day.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I watch upon the mountain-side<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For one of courage true and tried,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who should ride by this way,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it began. When she first heard that Beth had written that ballad,
Charlotte was astonished. It was the only assertion of Beth's she had
ever doubted; but Beth assured her that any one could write verses, and
convinced her by "making some up" there and then on a subject which she
got Charlotte to choose for her.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Many things passed on the road below&mdash;teams of waggons, drawn by
beautiful big cart-horses with glossy coats, well cared for, tossing
their headland rattling the polished brasses of their harness proudly,
signs of successful farming and affluence; smart carriages with what
Beth called "silly-fool ladies, good for nothing," in them; a carrier's
cart, pedestrians innumerable, and then&mdash;then, at last, a solitary big
brown horse, ridden at a steady canter by a slender girl in a brown
habit (worn by her mother in her youth, and borrowed from her wardrobe
without permission for the occasion). The horse was a broken-down racer
with some spirit left, which Beth had hired, as she had procured the
provisions, on a promise to pay. In passing, she waved a white
handkerchief carelessly, as if she were flicking flies from the horse,
but <i>without relenting her speed</i>. This was the signal agreed upon.
Charlotte, glowing with excitement, and greatly relieved, watched the
adventurous rider out of sight; then trudged off bravely to the Flat
Rock, miles away behind the far pier, where she loyally deposited the
blue missive. The red one she destroyed by fire according to orders.</p>

<p>Beth had warned her that she would be tired to death when she got in,
and had better snatch some repose in preparation for the night.</p>

<p>"But if I oversleep myself and am not on the look-out for you when you
come, what will you do?" Charlotte objected.</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," said Beth.</p>

<p>And Charlotte did accordingly with perfect confidence.</p>

<p>When she awoke the room was dark, but there was a motionless figure
sitting in the window, clearly silhouetted against the sky. Charlotte,
who expected surprises, was pleasantly startled.</p>

<p>"Is all safe in the west, sister?" she said softly, raising herself on
her elbow.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "but clouds are gathering in the north. Our hope
is in the east. Let us pray for the sunrise. You left the letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. As fast as I could fly I went."</p>

<p>"Ah! then it will be gone by this time!" Beth ejaculated with
conviction. The Flat Rock was only uncovered at low water, and now the
tide was high. "Can you get me some food, little one, for I am
famished?" she proceeded. "I have had nothing since the morning, and
have ridden far, and have done much."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" said Charlotte. "And you got me such good things!"</p>

<p>"Ah! that was different," Beth rejoined.</p>

<p>Charlotte stole downstairs. Her father had been out seeing his patients
all day, and had not troubled about her.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>She returned with chicken and ham, cold apple-tart and cream, and a
little jug of cider.</p>

<p>Poor Beth, accustomed to the most uninteresting food, and not enough of
that, was so exhausted by her long fast and arduous labours, that she
found it difficult to restrain her tears at the sight of such good
things. She ate and drank with seemly self-restraint, however; it would
have lowered her much in her own estimation if she had showed any sign
of the voracity she felt.</p>

<p>Then the watch began. Having wrapped themselves up in their walking
things to be ready for any emergency, they locked the door and opened
the window softly. They were in a room at the top of the house, which,
being next door to the Benyons, commanded the same extensive view down
the front street and a bit of Rock Street and the back street, and up
Orchard Street on the left to the church. They were watching for a
sailor in a smart yachting suit, a man-of-war's man with bare feet, and
a priest in a heavy black cloak. Beth, greatly refreshed and stimulated
by her supper and the cider, fell into her most fascinating mood; and
Charlotte listened enthralled to wonderful descriptions of places she
had visited with Hector, sights she had seen, and events she had taken
part in.</p>

<p>"But how is it you are not missed from home when you go away like that?"
said Charlotte.</p>

<p>"How is it I am not missed to-night?" Beth answered. "When you are fully
initiated into the Secret Service of Humanity you will find that things
happen in a way you would never suspect."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is all right and proper being so much alone with single
gentlemen," Charlotte just ventured.</p>

<p>"All things are right and proper so long as you do nothing wrong," Beth
answered sententiously.</p>

<p>Lights began to move from room to room in the houses about them,
gigantic shadows of people appeared on white window blinds in fantastic
poses, and there was much moving to and fro as they prepared for bed.
Then one by one the lights went out, and in the little old-fashioned
window-panes the dark brightness of the sky and the crystal stars alone
were reflected. It was a fine clear night, the gas burnt brightly in the
quiet streets, there was not a soul stirring.</p>

<p>"Isn't it exquisite?" said Beth, sniffing the sweet air. "I am glad I
was born, if it is only for the sake of being alive at night."</p>

<p>After this they were silent. Then by degrees the desire for sleep became
imperative, and they both suffered acutely in their efforts to resist
it. Finally Charlotte was vanquished, and Beth made her lie down on the
bed. As she dropped off she saw

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
 Beth sitting rigidly at the open
window; when she awoke it was bright daylight, and Beth was still there
in exactly the same attitude.</p>

<p>"Beth," she exclaimed, "you are superhuman!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Beth, with a mysterious smile, "when you have learnt to
listen to the whispers of the night, and know what they signify as I do,
you will not wonder. Marvellous things have been happening while you
slept."</p>

<p>"O Beth!" said Charlotte reproachfully, "why didn't you wake me?"</p>

<p>"I was forbidden," Beth answered sadly. "But now watch for me. It is
your turn, and I must sleep. A yachtsman or a man-of-war's man with bare
feet, remember."</p>

<p>Beth curled herself up on the bed, and Charlotte, very weary and aching
all over, but sternly determined to do her duty, took her place in the
window. She had her reward, however, and when Beth awoke she found her
all on the alert, for she had seen the yachtsman. He came up the street
and hung about a little, pretending to look at the shops, then walked
away briskly, which showed Charlotte that the plot was thickening, and
greatly excited her. Beth smiled and nodded as though well satisfied
when she heard the news, but preserved an enigmatical silence.</p>

<p>Then Charlotte went downstairs and smuggled her up such a good
breakfast&mdash;fried ham, boiled eggs, hot rolls with plenty of butter, and
delicious coffee&mdash;that the famishing Beth was fain to exclaim with
genuine enthusiasm&mdash;</p>

<p>"In spite of all the difficulty, danger, and privation we have to endure
in the Secret Service of Humanity, Charlotte, is there anything to equal
the delight of it?"</p>

<p>And Charlotte solemnly asseverated that there was not.</p>

<p>Much stimulated by her breakfast, Beth took leave of Charlotte. She must
be alone, she said, she had much to think about. She went to the farther
shore to be away from everybody. She wanted to hear what the little
waves were saying to the sand as they rippled over it. It was another
grey day, close and still, and the murmur of the calm sea threw her at
once into a dreamy state, full of pleasurable excitement. She hid
herself in a spot most soothing from its apparent remoteness, a sandy
cove from which, because of the projecting cliffs on either hand,
neither town nor coast could be seen, but only the sea and sky. Although
the grey was uniform enough to make it impossible to tell where cloud
met water on the horizon, it was not dull, but luminous with the
sunshine it enfolded, and full of colour in fine gradations as Beth
beheld it. She sat a long time on the warm dry sand, with her chin
resting on her knees, and her hands clasped round them, not gazing with
seeing eyes nor listening

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
 with open ears, but apprehending through her
further faculty the great harmony of Nature of which she herself was one
of the triumphant notes. At that moment she tasted life at its best and
fullest&mdash;life all ease and grace and beauty, without regret or
longing&mdash;perfect life in that she wanted nothing more. But she rose at
last, and, still gazing at the sea, slowly unclasped her waistbelt, and
let it fall on the sand at her feet; then she took her hat off, her
dress, her boots and stockings, everything, and stood, ivory-white, with
bright brown wavy hair, against the lilac greyness under the tall dark
cliffs. The little waves had called her, coming up closer and closer,
and fascinating her, until, yielding to their allurements, she went in
amongst them, and floated on them, or lay her length in the shallows,
letting them ripple over her, and make merry about her, the gladdest
girl alive, yet with the wrapt impassive face of a devotee whose ecstasy
is apart from all that acts on mere flesh and makes expression. All
through life Beth had her moments, and they were generally such as this,
when her higher self was near upon release from its fetters, and she
arose an interval towards oneness with the Eternal.</p>

<p>But on this occasion she was surprised in her happy solitude. A troop of
what Mrs. Caldwell called "common girls" came suddenly round the cliff
into her sheltered nook, with shouts of laughter, also bent on bathing.
Beth plunged in deeper to cover herself the moment they appeared; but
they did not expect her to have anything on, and her modesty was lost
upon them.</p>

<p>"How's the water?" they shouted.</p>

<p>"Delicious," she answered, glad to find them friendly.</p>

<p>They undressed as they came along, and were very soon, all of them,
playing about her, ducking and splashing each other, and Beth also,
including her sociably in their game. And Beth, as was her wont,
responded so cordially that she was very soon heading the man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p>"We shall all be ill if we stay in any longer," she said at last. "I
shall take one more dip and go and dress. Let's all take hands and dip
in a row."</p>

<p>They did so, and then, still hand in hand, scampered up on to the beach.</p>

<p>"My!" one of them exclaimed, when they came to their clothes and had
broken the line,&mdash;"My! ain't <i>she</i> nice!"</p>

<p>Then all the other girls stood and stared at Beth, whose fine limbs and
satin-smooth white skin, so different in colour and texture from their
own, drew from them the most candid expressions of admiration.</p>

<p>Beth, covered with confusion, hurried on a garment all wet as she was,
for she had no towel; and then, in order to distract their attention
from her body, she began to display her mind.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, I have had a good time!" one of the girls exclaimed. "Let's come
again often."</p>

<p>"Let us form a secret society," said Beth, "and I will be your leader,
and we'll have a watchword and a sign; and when the water is right, I'll
send the word round, and then we'll start out unobserved, and meet here,
and bathe in secret."</p>

<p>"My! that would be fine!" the girls agreed.</p>

<p>"But that's not all," said Beth, standing with her chemise only half on,
oblivious of everything now but her subject. "It would be much better
than that. There would be much more in it. We could meet in the fields
by moonlight, and I would drill you, and show you a great many things,
all for the Secret Service of Humanity. You don't know what we're doing!
We're going to make the world just like heaven, and everybody will be
good and beautiful, and have enough of everything, and we shall all be
happy, because nobody will care to be happy unless everybody else has
been made so. But it will be very hard work to bring it about. The
wicked people are doing all they can to prevent us, and the devil
himself is fighting against us. We shall conquer, however; and those who
are first in the fight will be first for the glory!"</p>

<p>The girls, some standing, some sitting, most of them with nothing on,
remained motionless while she spoke, not understanding much, yet so
moved by the power of her personality, that when she exclaimed, "Well,
what do you say, girls? will you join?" they all exclaimed with
enthusiasm, "We will! we will!"</p>

<p>And then they made haste to dress as if the millennium could be hurried
here by the rate at which they put on their clothes. Beth then and there
composed a terrible oath, binding them to secrecy and obedience, and
swore them all in solemnly; then she chose one for her orderly, who was
to take round the word on occasion; and they were all to meet again in
the fields behind the church on Saturday at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, not a word!</p>

<p>Beth made Charlotte captain of the band; and drills, bathing rites, and
other mysteries were regularly conducted, the girls being bound together
more securely by the fascination of Beth's discourses, and the continual
interest she managed to inspire, than by any respect they had for an
oath. Beth's interest in them extended to the smallest detail of their
lives. She knew which would be absent from drill because it was
washing-day, and which was weak for want of food; and she resumed her
poaching habits&mdash;only on Uncle James Patten's estate, of course&mdash;and,
having beguiled a gunsmith into letting her have an air-gun on credit,
she managed to snare and shoot birds enough to relieve their necessities
to an appreciable extent. She never let

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
 any one into the secret of
those supplies, and the mystery added greatly to her credit with the
girls.</p>

<p>That season some friends of the Benyons brought their boys to stay at
Rainharbour for the holidays, and Beth varied her other pursuits by
rambling about with them, Lady Benyon having seen to it that she made
their acquaintance legitimately, for the old lady shrewdly suspected
that Beth was already beginning to attract attention. From her post of
observation in the window she had seen young men turn in the street and
look back at the slender girl, in spite of her short petticoats, with
more interest than many a maturer figure aroused; and she had heard that
Beth Caldwell was already much discussed. Beth's brother Jim, when he
came home that summer, also began to introduce her to his young men
friends in the neighbourhood, so that very soon Beth had quite a little
court about her on the pier when the band played. She liked the boys,
and the young men she found an absorbing study; but not one of them
touched her heart. Her acquaintance with Alfred had made her fastidious.
He had had sense enough to respect her, and his companionship had given
her a fine foretaste of the love that is ennobling, the love that makes
for high ideals of character and conduct, for fine purpose, spiritual
power, and intellectual development, the one kind worth cultivating. In
these more sophisticated youths she found nothing soul-sustaining. She
philandered with some of them up to the point where comparisons become
inevitable, and, so long as they met her in a spirit of frank
camaraderie, it was agreeable enough; but when, with their commonplace
minds, they presumed to be sentimental, they became intolerable. Still
the glow was there in her breast often and often, and would be
momentarily directed towards one and another; but the brightness of it
only showed the defects in each; and so she remained in love with love
alone, and the power of passion in her, thwarted, was transmuted into
mental energy.</p>

<p>But Beth learnt a good deal from her young men that summer&mdash;learnt her
own power, for one thing, when she found that she could twist the whole
lot of them round her little finger if she chose. The thing about them
that interested her most, however, was their point of view. She found
one trait common to all of them when they talked to her, and that was a
certain assumption of superiority which impressed her very much at
first, so that she was prepared to accept their opinions as confidently
as they gave them; and they always had one ready to give on no matter
what subject. Beth, perceiving that this superiority was not innate,
tried to discover how it was acquired that she might cultivate it.
Gathering from their attitude towards her ignorance that this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
superiority rested somehow on a knowledge of the Latin grammar, she
hunted up an old one of her brother's and opened it with awe, so much
seemed to depend on it. Verbs and declensions came easily enough to her,
however. The construction of the language was puzzling at the outset;
but, with a little help, she soon discovered that even in that there was
nothing occult. Any industrious, persevering person could learn a
language, she decided; and then she made more observations. She
discovered that, in the estimation of men, feminine attributes are all
inferior to masculine attributes. Any evidence of reasoning capacity in
a woman they held to be abnormal, and they denied that women were ever
logical. They had to allow that women's intuition was often accurate,
but it was inferior, nevertheless, they maintained, to man's uncertain
reason; and such qualities as were undeniable they managed to discount,
as, for instance, in the matter of endurance. If women were long
enduring, they said, it was not because their fortitude was greater, but
because they were less sensitive to suffering, and so, in point of fact,
suffered less than men would under the circumstances.</p>

<p>This persistent endeavour to exalt themselves by lowering women struck
Beth as mean, and made her thoughtful. She began by respecting their
masculine minds as much as they did themselves; but then came a doubt if
they were any larger and more capable than the minds of women would be
if they were properly trained and developed; and she began to dip into
the books they prided themselves on having read, to see if they were
past her comprehension. She studied Pope's translation of the Iliad and
Odyssey indoors, and she also took the little volume out under her arm;
but this was a pose, for she could not read out of doors, there were
always so many other interests to occupy her attention&mdash;birds and
beasts, men and women, trees and flowers, land and water; all much more
entrancing than the Iliad or Odyssey. Long years afterwards she returned
to these old-world works with keen appreciation, and wondered at her
early self; but when she read them first, she took their meanings too
literally, and soon wearied of warlike heroes, however great a number of
their fellow-creatures they might slay at a time, and of chattel
heroines, however beautiful, which was all that Homer conveyed to her;
not did she find herself elated by her knowledge of their exploits. She
noticed, however, that the acquisition of such knowledge imposed upon
the boys, and gained her a reputation for cleverness which made the
young university prigs think it worth their while to talk to her. They
had failed to discover her natural powers because there was no one to
tell them she had any, and they only thought what they were told to
think about people and things, and admired what they were told

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> to
admire. In this Beth differed from them widely, for she began by having
tastes of her own. She did not believe that they enjoyed Homer a bit
more than she did; but the right pose was to pretend that they did; so
they posed and pretended, according to order, and Beth posed and
pretended too, just to see what would come of it.</p>

<p>It was a young tutor in charge of a reading-party who helped Beth with
the Latin grammar. He managed to ingratiate himself with Mrs. Caldwell,
and came often to the house; and finally he began to teach Beth Latin at
her own request, and with the consent of her mother. The lessons had not
gone on very long, however, before he tried to insinuate into his
teaching some of the kind of sophistries which another tutor had imposed
by way of moral philosophy on Rousseau's Madame de Warens in her
girlhood, to her undoing. This was all new to Beth, and she listened
with great interest; but she failed utterly to see why not believing in
a God should make it right and proper for her to embrace the tutor: so
the lessons ended abruptly. Beth profited largely by the acquaintance,
however,&mdash;not so much at the time, perhaps, as afterwards, when she was
older, and had gained knowledge enough of men of various kinds to enable
her to compare and reflect. It was her first introduction to the
commonplace cleverness of the academic mind, the mere acquisitive
faculty which lives on pillage, originates nothing itself, and, as a
rule, fails to understand, let alone appreciate, originality in others.
The young tutor's ambition was to be one of a shining literary clique of
extraordinary cheapness which had just then begun to be formed. The
taint of a flippant wit was common to all its members, and their
assurance was unbounded. They undertook to extinguish anybody with a few
fine phrases; and, in their conceited irreverence, they even attacked
eternal principles, the sources of the best inspiration of all ages, and
pronounced sentence upon them. Repute of a kind they gained, but it was
by glib falsifications of all that is noble in sentiment, thought, and
action, all that is good and true. It was the contraction of her own
heart, the chill and dulness that settled upon her when she was with
this man, as compared to the glow and expansion, the release of her
finer faculties, which she had always experienced when under the
influence of Aunt Victoria's simple goodness, that first put Beth in the
way of observing how inferior in force and charm mere intellect is to
spiritual power, and how soon it bores, even when brilliant, if
unaccompanied by other endowments, qualities of heart and soul, such as
constancy, loyalty, truthfulness, and that scrupulous honesty of action
which answers to what is expected as well as to what is known of us.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth played very diligently at learning during this experiment, but only
played for a time. The mind in process of forming itself involuntarily
rejects all that is unnecessary, and that kind of knowledge was not for
her. It opened up no prospect of pleasure in itself. All she cared to
know was what it felt like to have mastered it; and that she arrived at
by resolving herself into a lady of great attainments, who talked
altogether about things she had learnt, but had nothing in her mind
besides. A mind with nothing else in it, in Beth's sense of the word,
was to Beth what plainness is to beauty; so, while many of her
contemporaries were stultifying themselves with Greek and Latin
ingenuities, she pursued the cultivation of that in herself which is
beyond our ordinary apprehension, that which is more potent than
knowledge, more fertilising to the mind&mdash;that by which knowledge is
converted from a fallow field into a fruitful garden. Altogether, apart
from her special subject, she learnt only enough of anything to express
herself; but it was extraordinary how aptly she utilised all that was
necessary for her purpose, and how invariably she found what she
wanted&mdash;if found be the right word; for it was rather as if information
were flashed into her mind from some outside agency at critical times
when she could not possibly have done without it.</p>

<p>One sad consequence of her separation from Alfred, and the strange
things she did and dreamed for distraction in the unrest of her mind,
was a change in her constitution. Her first fine flush of health was
over, the equability of her temper was disturbed, and she became subject
to hysterical outbursts of garrulity, to fits of moody silence, to
apparently causeless paroxysms of laughter or tears; and she was always
anxious. She had real cause for anxiety, however, for, in her efforts to
realise her romance to Charlotte's satisfaction, she had run up little
bills all over the place. What would happen when they were presented, as
they certainly would be sooner or later, she dared not think; but the
dread of the moment preyed upon her mind to such an extent that,
whenever she heard a knock at the door, she entreated God to grant that
it might not be a bill. And even when there were no knocks, she went on
entreating to be spared, and worked herself into such a chronic fever of
worry that she was worn to a shadow, and developed a racking cough which
gave her no peace.</p>

<p>Just at this time, too, the whole place began to be scandalised by her
vagaries, her mysterious expeditions on the big brown horse, and her
constant appearance in public with a coterie of young men about her. At
a time when anything unconventional in a girl was clear evidence of vice
to all the men and most of the women who knew of it, Beth's reputation
was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
 bound to suffer, and it became so bad at last that Dr. Hardy
forbade Charlotte to associate with her. Charlotte told her with tears,
and begged to be allowed to meet her in the Secret Service of Humanity
as usual; but Beth refused. She said it was too dangerous just then,
they must wait; the truth being that she was sick of the Secret Service
of Humanity, of Charlotte, of everything and everybody that prevented
her hearing when there was a knock at the door, and praying to the Lord
that it might not be a bill.</p>

<p>The secret society was practically dissolved by this time, and very soon
afterwards the catastrophe Beth had been dreading occurred, and wrought
a great change in her life. It happened one day when she was not at
home. Aunt Grace Mary was so alarmed by her cough and the delicacy of
her appearance that she had braved Uncle James and carried her off to
stay with her at Fairholm for a change. Once she was away from the sound
of the knocks, Beth suffered less, and began to revive and be herself
again to the extent of taking Aunt Grace Mary into her confidence
boldly.</p>

<p>"Beth, Beth, Beth!" said that poor good lady tenderly, "you naughty
girl, how could you! Running in debt with nothing to pay; why, it isn't
honest!"</p>

<p>"So <i>I</i> think," said Beth in cordial agreement, taking herself aside
from her own acts, as it were, and considering them impartially. "Help
me out of this scrape, Aunt Grace Mary, and I'll never get into such
another."</p>

<p>"But how much do you owe, Beth dear?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," Beth answered. "Pounds for Tom Briggs alone."</p>

<p>"Who's <i>he</i>?" was Aunt Grace Mary's horrified exclamation.</p>

<p>"Oh, only the horse&mdash;a dark bay with black points. I rode him a lot, and
oh! it <i>was</i> nice! It was like poetry, like living it, you know, like
being a poem one's self. And I'm glad I did it. If I should die for it,
I couldn't regret it. And I shouldn't wonder if I did die, for I feel as
if those knocks had fairly knocked me to bits."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Beth, you silly child, don't talk like that," said Aunt Grace
Mary. "What else do you owe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, then there's Mrs. Andrews, the confectioner's, bill."</p>

<p>"Confectioner's!" Aunt Grace Mary exclaimed. "O Beth! I never thought
you were greedy."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think I am," Beth answered temperately. "I've been very
hungry, though. But I never touched any of those good things myself. I
only got them for Charlotte when she had heavy work to do for the Secret
Service of Humanity."</p>

<p>"The <i>what</i>?" Aunt Grace Mary demanded.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"The game we played. Then there's the hairdresser's bill, that must be
pretty big. I had to get curls and plaits and combs and things, besides
having my hair dressed for entertainments to which I was obliged to
go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beth! <i>are</i> you mad?" Aunt Grace Mary interrupted. "You've never been
to an entertainment in your life."</p>

<p>"No," Beth answered casually, "but I've played at going to no end of a
lot."</p>

<p>"Well, this is the most extraordinary game I ever heard of!"</p>

<p>"But it was such an exciting game," Beth pleaded with a sigh.</p>

<p>"But, my dear child, such a reckless, unprincipled game!"</p>

<p>"But you don't think of that at the time," Beth assured her. "It's all
real and right then. We&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here the colloquy was interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. Caldwell in
a state of distraction with the hairdresser's bill in her hand. Aunt
Grace Mary made her sit down, and patted her shoulder soothingly. Uncle
James was out. Beth, greatly relieved, looked on with interest. She knew
that the worst was over.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Caroline," Aunt Grace Mary said cheerfully. "Beth has just
been telling me all about it. Confession is good for the saints, you
know, or the soul, or something; so that's cheering. She has been very
naughty, very naughty indeed, but she is very sorry. She sincerely
regrets. Hairdresser, did you say? Oh, give it to me! Now, do give it to
me, <i>there's</i> a dear! And we won't have another word about it. Beth, you
bad girl, be good, and say you repent."</p>

<p>"Say it!" Beth ejaculated, coughing. "Look at me, and you'll see it,
Aunt Grace Mary. I've been repenting myself to pieces for months."</p>

<p>"Well, dear; well, dear," Aunt Grace Mary rejoined, beaming blandly,
"that will do; that's enough, I'm sure. Mamma forgives you, so we'll
have no more about it."</p>

<p>The hairdresser's bill was the only one Mrs. Caldwell ever heard of, for
Aunt Grace Mary got the use of her pony carriage next day, by telling
Uncle James her mamma had sent Caroline to say she particularly wished
her to take Beth to see her. Uncle James, to whom any whim of Lady
Benyon's was wisdom, ordered the carriage for them himself; and, as they
drove off together, Aunt Grace Mary remarked to Beth, "I think I managed
that very cleverly; don't you?" Naturally estimable women are forced
into habits of dissimulation by the unreason of the tyrant in authority
in many families; and Aunt Grace Mary was one of the victims. She had
been obliged to resort to these small deceits for so many years, that
all she felt about them now was a sort of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
 mild triumph when they were
successful. "I mean to go and see mamma, you know, so it won't be any
story," she added.</p>

<p>She went with Beth first, however, to the various shops where Beth owed
money, and paid her debts; and Beth was so overcome by her generosity,
and so anxious to prove her repentance, that she borrowed sixpence more
from her, and went straightway to the hairdresser's, and had all her
pretty hair cropped off close like a boy's, by way of atonement. When
she appeared, Lady Benyon burst out laughing; but her mother was even
more seriously annoyed than she had been by the hairdresser's bill.
Beth's hair had added considerably to her market value in Mrs.
Caldwell's estimation. She would not have put it so coarsely, but that
was what her feeling on the subject amounted to.</p>

<p>"What is to be done with such a child?" she exclaimed in despair.</p>

<p>"Send her to school," Aunt Grace Mary gasped.</p>

<p>"She would be expelled in a month," Mrs. Caldwell averred.</p>

<p>"Possibly; but it would be worth the trial," Aunt Grace Mary rejoined in
her breathless way.</p>

<p>"Yes," Lady Benyon agreed. "She has been at home far too long, running
wild, and it's the only thing to be done. But let it be a strict
school."</p>

<p>"How am I to afford it?" Mrs. Caldwell wailed, rocking herself on her
chair.</p>

<p>"Well, there's the Royal Service School for Officers' Daughters; you can
get her in there for next to nothing, and it's strict enough," Lady
Benyon suggested.</p>

<p>And finally, after the loss of some more precious time, and with much
reluctance, Mrs. Caldwell yielded to public opinion, and decided to
deprive Jim of Beth's little income, and send Beth to school, some new
enormities of Beth's having helped considerably to hasten her mother's
decision.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Caldwell's</span> married life had been one long
sacrifice of herself, her
health, her comfort, her every pleasure, to what she conceived to be
right and dutiful. Duty and right were the only two words approaching to
a religious significance that she was not ashamed to use; to her all the
other words savoured of cant, and even these two she pronounced without
emphasis or solemnity, lest the sense in which she used them might be
mistaken for a piece of religiosity. Of the joy and gladness of religion
the poor lady had no conception.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, as has already been said, Mrs. Caldwell was an admirable
person, according to the light of her time. To us she appears to have
been a good woman marred, first of all, by the narrow outlook, the
ignorance and prejudices which were the result of the mental
restrictions imposed upon her sex; secondly, by having no conception of
her duty to herself; and finally, by those mistaken notions of her duty
to others which were so long inflicted upon women, to be their own curse
and the misfortune of all whom they were designed to benefit. She had
sacrificed her health in her early married life to what she believed to
be her duty as a wife, and so had left herself neither nerve nor
strength enough for the never-ending tasks of the mistress of a
household and mother of a family on a small income, the consequence of
which was that shortness of temper and querulousness which spoilt her
husband's life and made her own a burden to her. She was highly
intelligent, but had carefully preserved her ignorance of life, because
it was not considered womanly to have any practical knowledge of the
world; and she had neglected the general cultivation of her mind partly
because intellectual pursuits were a pleasure, and she did not feel
sufficiently self-denying if she allowed herself any but exceptional
pleasures, but also because there was a good deal of her husband's work
in the way of letters and official documents that she could do for him,
and these left her no time for anything but the inevitable making and
mending. Busy men take a sensible amount of rest and relaxation, of food
and fresh air, and make good speed; but busy women look upon outdoor
exercise as a luxury, talk about wasting time on meals, and toil on
incessantly yet with ever-diminishing strength, because they take no
time to recoup; therefore they recede rather than advance; all the extra
effort but makes for leeway.</p>

<p>The consequence of Mrs. Caldwell's ridiculous education was that her
judgment was no more developed in most respects than it had been in her
girlhood, so that when she lost her husband and had to act for her
children, she had nothing better to rely on for her guidance than
time-honoured conventions, which she accepted with unquestioning faith
in their efficacy, even when applied to emergencies such as were never
known in the earlier ages of human evolution to which they belonged. She
had starved herself and her daughters in mind and body in order to
scrape together the wherewithal to send her sons out into the world, but
she had let them go without making any attempt to help them to form
sound principles, or to teach them rules of conduct such as should keep
them clean-hearted and make them worthy members of society; so that all
her privation had been worse than vain, it had been mischievous; for the
boys, unaided by any

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
 scheme or comprehensive view of life, any
knowledge of the meaning of it to show them what was worth aiming at,
and also unprotected by positive principles, had drifted along the
commonest course of self-seeking and self-indulgence, and were neither a
comfort nor a credit to her. However, she was satisfied that she had
done her best for them, and therefore, being of the days when the
woman's sphere was home exclusively, and home meant, for the most part,
the nursery and the kitchen, she sat inactive and suffered, as was the
wont of old-world women, while her sons were sinning all the sins which
she especially should have taught them to abhor; and, with regard to her
girls, she was equally satisfied that she had done the right thing by
them under the circumstances. She could not have been made to comprehend
that Beth, a girl, was the one member of the family who deserved a good
chance, the only one for whom it would have repaid her to procure extra
advantages; but having at last been convinced that there was nothing for
it but to send Beth to school, she set to work to prepare her to the
best of her ability. Her own clothes were in the last stage of
shabbiness, but what money she had she spent on getting new ones for
Beth, and that, too, in order that she might continue the allowance to
Jim as long as possible. She made a mighty effort also to teach Beth all
that was necessary for the entrance examination into the school, and
sewed day and night to get the things ready&mdash;in all of which, be it
said, Beth helped to the best of her ability, but without pride or
pleasure, because she had been made to feel that she was robbing Jim,
and that her mother was treating her better than she deserved, and the
feeling depressed her, so that the much-longed-for chance, when it came,
found her with less spirit than she had ever had to take advantage of
it.</p>

<p>"Ah, Beth!" her mother said to her, seeing her so subdued, "I thought
you would repent when it was too late. You won't find it so easy and
delightful to have your own way as you suppose. When it comes to leaving
home and going away among strangers who don't care a bit about you, you
will not be very jubilant, I expect. You know what it is when Mildred
leaves home, how she cries!"</p>

<p>"Summer showers, soft, warm, and refreshing," Beth snapped, irritated by
the I-told-you-so tone of superiority, which, when her mother assumed
it, always broke down her best resolutions, and threw her into a state
of opposition. "Mildred the Satisfactory has the right thing ready for
all occasions."</p>

<p>The result of this encounter was an elaborate pose. In dread of her
mother's comments, should she betray the feeling expected of her, she
set herself to maintain an unruffled calm of demeanour, whatever
happened.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Autumn was tinting the woods when Beth packed up. The day before her
departure she paid a round of visits, not to people, but to places,
which shows how much more real the life of her musings was to her at
that time than the life of the world. She got up at daybreak and went
and sat on the rustic seat at the edge of the cliff where the stream
fell over on to the sand, and thought of the first sunrise she had ever
seen, and of the puritan farmer who had come out and reprimanded her
ruggedly for being there alone at that unseemly hour. Poor man! His
little house behind her was shut up and deserted, the garden he had kept
so trim was all bedraggled, neglect ruled ruin all over his small
demesne, and he himself was where the worthy rest till their return. The
thought, however, at that hour and in that heavenly solitude, where
there was no sound but the sea-voice which filled every pause in an
undertone with the great song of eternity it sings on always, did not
sadden Beth, but, on the contrary, stimulated her with some singular
vague perception of the meaning of it all. The dawn was breaking, and
the spirit of the dawn all about her possessed and drew her till she
revelled in an ecstasy of yearning towards its crowning glory&mdash;Rise,
Great Sun! When she first sat down, the hollow of the sky was one dark
dome, only relieved by a star or two; but the darkness parted more
rapidly than her eyes could appreciate, and was succeeded, in the hollow
it had held, by rolling clouds monotonously grey, which, in turn, ranged
themselves in long low downs, irregularly ribbed, and all unbroken, but
gradually drawing apart until at length they were gently riven, and the
first triumphant tinge of topaz colour, pale pink, warm and clear, like
the faint flush that shyly betrays some delicate emotion on a young
cheek, touched the soft gradations of the greyness to warmth and
brightness, then mounted up and up in shafts to the zenith, while behind
it was breathed in the tenderest tinge of turquoise blue, which shaded
to green, which shaded to primrose low down on the horizon, where all
was shining silver. Then, as the grey, so was the colour riven, and rays
of light shot up, crimson flashes of flame, which, while Beth held her
breath, were fast followed from the sea by the sun, that rose enwrapt in
their splendour, while the water below caught the fine flush, and heaved
and heaved like a breast expanding with delight into long deep sighs.</p>

<p>Beth cried aloud: "O Lord of Loveliness! how mighty are Thy
manifestations!"</p>

<p>Later in the day she climbed to the top of the hill where Charlotte had
kept her faithful watch for the dark-brown horse, and there, beneath the
firs, she sat looking out, with large eyes straining far into the vague
distance where Hector had been.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The ground was padded with pine-needles, briony berries shone in the
hedgerows below, and hips and haws and rowans also rioted in red.
Brambles were heavy with blue-black berries, and the bracken was
battered and brown on the steep hill-side. Down in the road a team of
four horses, dappled bays with black points and coats as glossy as
satin, drawing a waggon of wheat, curved their necks and tossed their
heads till the burnished brasses of their harness rang, and pacing with
pride, as if they rejoiced to carry the harvest home. On the top of the
wheat two women in coloured cotton frocks rested and sang&mdash;sang quite
blithely.</p>

<p>Beth watched the waggon out of sight, then rose, and turning, faced the
sea. As she descended the hill she left that dream behind her. Hector,
like Sammy and Arthur, passed to the background of her recollections,
where her lovers ceased from troubling, and the Secret Service of
Humanity, superseded, was no more a living interest.</p>

<p>Beth went also to the farther sands to visit the spot where she had been
surprised in the water by the girls, and had become the white priestess
of their bathing rites, and taught that girls had a strength as great as
the strength of boys, but different, if only they would do things. Mere
mental and physical strength were what Beth was thinking of; she knew
nothing of spiritual force, although she was using it herself at the
time, and doing with it what all the boys in the diocese, taken
together, could not have done. She had heard of works of the Spirit, and
that she should pray to be imbued with it; but that she herself was pure
spirit, only waiting to be released from her case of clay, had never
been hinted to her.</p>

<p>The next day she travelled with her mother from the north to the south,
and during the whole long journey there was no break in the unruffled
calm of her demeanour. Her mother wondered at her, and was irritated,
and fussed about the luggage, and fumed about trains she feared to miss;
but Beth kept calm. She sat in her corner of the carriage looking out of
the window, and the world was a varied landscape, to every beauty of
which she was keenly alive, yet she gave no expression to her
enthusiasm, nor to the discomfort she suffered from the August sun,
which streamed in on her through the blindless window, burning her face
for hours, nor to her hunger and fatigue; and when at last they came to
the great house by the river, and her mother, having handed her over to
Miss Clifford, the lady principal, said, somewhat tearfully, "Good-bye,
Beth! I hope you will be happy here. But be a good girl." Beth answered,
"Thank you. I shall try, mamma," and kissed her as coolly as if it were
her usual good-night.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"We do not often have young ladies part from their mothers so placidly,"
Miss Clifford commented.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," Mrs. Caldwell said, sighing.</p>

<p>Beth felt that she was behaving horridly. There was a lump in her
throat, and she would liked to have shown more feeling, but she could
not. Now, when she would have laid aside the mask of calmness which she
had voluntarily assumed, she found herself forced to wear it.
Falsifications of our better selves are easily entered upon, but hard to
shake off. They are evil things that lurk about us, ready but powerless
to come till we call them; but, having been called, they hold us in
their grip, and their power upon us to compel us becomes greater than
ours upon them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell felt sore at heart when she had gone, and Beth was not
less sore. Each had been a failure in her relation to the other. Mrs.
Caldwell blamed Beth, and Beth, in her own mind, did not defend herself.
She forbore to judge.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Catherine's Mansion,</span> the Royal Service School for Officers'
Daughters, had not been built for the purpose, but bought, otherwise it
would have been as ugly to look at as it was dreary to live in. As it
was, however, the house was beautiful, and so also were the grounds
about it, and the views of the river, the bridge with its many arches,
and the grey town climbing up from it to the height above.</p>

<p>Beth was still standing at the top of the steps under the great portico,
where her mother had left her, contemplating the river, which was the
first that had flowed into her experience.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear, come in!" some one behind her exclaimed
impatiently. "You're not allowed to stand there."</p>

<p>Beth turned and saw a thin, dry, middle-aged woman, with keen dark eyes
and a sharp manner, standing in the doorway behind her, with a
gentler-looking lady, who said, "It is a new girl, Miss Bey. I expect
she is all bewildered."</p>

<p>"No, I am not at all bewildered, thank you," Beth answered in her easy
way. As she spoke she saw two grown-up girls in the hall exchange
glances and smile, and wondered what unusual thing she had done.</p>

<p>"Then you had better come at once," Miss Bey rejoined drily, "and let me
see what you can do. Please to remember in future that the girls are not
allowed to come to this door."</p>

<p>She led the way as she spoke, and Beth followed her across

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> the hall, up
a broad flight of steps opposite the entrance, down a wide corridor to
the right, and then to the right again, into a narrow class-room, and
through that again into another inner room.</p>

<p>"These are the fifth and sixth rooms," Miss Bey remarked,&mdash;"fifth and
sixth classes."</p>

<p>They were furnished with long bare tables, forms, hard wooden chairs, a
cupboard, and a set of pigeon-holes. Miss Bey sat down at the end of the
table in the "sixth," with her back to the window, and made Beth sit on
her left. There were some books, a large slate, a slate pencil, and damp
sponge on the table.</p>

<p>"What arithmetic have you done?" Miss Bey began.</p>

<p>"I've scrambled through the first four rules," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Set yourself a sum in each, and do it," Miss Bey said sharply, taking a
piece of knitting from a bag she held on her arm, and beginning to knit
in a determined manner, as if she were working against time.</p>

<p>Beth took up the slate and pencil, and began; but the sharp click-click
of the needles worried her, and her brain was so busy studying Miss Bey
she could not concentrate her mind upon the sums.</p>

<p>Miss Bey waited without a word, but Beth was conscious of her keen eyes
fixed upon her from time to time, and knew what she meant.</p>

<p>"I'm hurrying all I can," she said at last.</p>

<p>"You'll have to hurry more than you can, then, in class," Miss Bey
remarked, "if this is your ordinary rate of work."</p>

<p>When the sums were done, she took the slate and glanced over them. "They
are every one wrong," she said; "but I see you know how to work them.
Now clean the slate, and do some dictation."</p>

<p>She took up a book when Beth was ready, and began to read aloud from it.
Beth became so interested in the subject that she forgot the dictation,
and burst out at last, "Well, I never knew that before."</p>

<p>"You are doing dictation now," Miss Bey observed severely.</p>

<p>"All right, go on," Beth cheerfully rejoined.</p>

<p>Miss Bey did not go on, however, and on looking up to see what was the
matter, Beth found her gazing at her with bent brows.</p>

<p>"May I ask what your name is?" Miss Bey inquired.</p>

<p>"Beth Caldwell."</p>

<p>"Then allow me to inform you, Miss Beth Caldwell, that 'all right, go
on,' is not the proper way to address the head-mistress of the Royal
Service School for Officers' Daughters."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you for telling me," Beth answered. "You see I don't know these
things. I always say that to mamma."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been to school before?" Miss Bey asked.</p>

<p>"No," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Miss Bey ejaculated, with peculiar meaning. "Then you will have a
great deal to learn."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," Beth rejoined. "But that's what I came for, you know&mdash;to
learn. It's high time I began!"</p>

<p>She fixed her big eyes on the blank wall opposite, and there was a
sorrowful expression in them. Miss Bey noted the expression, and nodded
her head several times, but there was no relaxation of her peremptory
manner when she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Go on, my dear," she said. "If I give as much time to the others as you
are taking, I shall not get through the new girls to-night."</p>

<p>Beth finished her dictation.</p>

<p>"What a hand!" Miss Bey exclaimed. "Wherever did you learn to write like
that?"</p>

<p>"I taught myself to write small on purpose," Beth replied. "You can get
so much more on to the paper."</p>

<p>"You had better have taught yourself to spell, then," Miss Bey rejoined.
"There are four mistakes in this one passage."</p>

<p>Beth balanced her pencil on her finger with an air of indifference. She
was wondering how it was that the head-mistress of the Royal Service
School for Officers' Daughters used the word "wherever" as the vulgar
do.</p>

<p>The examination concluded with some questions in history and geography,
which Beth answered more or less incorrectly.</p>

<p>"I shall put you here in the sixth," Miss Bey informed her; "but rather
for your size than for your acquirements. There is a delicate girl, much
smaller than you are, in the first."</p>

<p>"Then I'd rather be myself, tall and strong, in the sixth," Beth
rejoined. "If I don't catch her up, at all events I shall have more
pleasure in life, and that's something."</p>

<p>Again Miss Bey gazed at her; but she was too much taken aback by Beth's
readiness to correct her on the instant, although it was an unaccustomed
and a monstrous thing for a girl to address a mistress in an easy
conversational way, let alone differ from her.</p>

<p>She took Beth to the great class-room where the seventh and eighth
worked, and the fifth and sixth joined them for recreation and
preparation, and where also the Bible lessons were given by Miss
Clifford to the whole school.</p>

<p>There were a good many girls of various ages in the room, who all looked
up.</p>

<p>"This is a new girl," Miss Bey said, addressing them generally,&mdash;"Miss

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Beth Caldwell. Please to show her where to go and what to do."</p>

<p>She glanced round keenly as she spoke, then left the room; and at the
same time a thin, sharp-looking little girl with short hair rose from
the table at which she was sitting and went up to Beth.</p>

<p>"I'm head of the fifth," she said. "Has Bey been examining you? What
class did she put you in?"</p>

<p>"The sixth," Beth said.</p>

<p>"I should have thought you'd have been in the third at least," the head
of the fifth piped, "you're so big. Here are some sixth girls&mdash;Jessie
Baker, Ina Formby, Rosa Bird."</p>

<p>The sixth girls were sitting at a round table, with their little desks
before them, writing letters. One of them pulled out a chair for Beth.
They had just returned from the holidays, and were in various stages of
home-sickness&mdash;some of them crying, and the rest depressed; but they
welcomed Beth kindly, as one of themselves, and inspected her with
interest.</p>

<p>"You can write a private letter to-day, you know," Rosa Bird said to
Beth.</p>

<p>"What is a private letter?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"One to your mother, you know, that isn't read. You seal it up yourself.
Public letters have to be sent in open to Miss Clifford. One week you
write a public letter, and the next a private one. Hello! here's Amy
Wynne!"</p>

<p>A dark girl of about eighteen had entered by a door at the farther end
of the room, and was received with acclamation, being evidently popular.
Beth, who was still in her mask of calm indifference, looked coldly on,
but in herself she determined to be received like that some day.</p>

<p>Most of the girls in the room jumped up, and Amy Wynne kissed one after
the other, and then shook hands with Beth.</p>

<p>"Are all my children back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Rosa Bird rejoined, glancing round. "They are not all
here."</p>

<p>"That's one of the mothers," Rosa explained to Beth when Amy Wynne had
gone again. "The first-class girls are mothers to us. You walk with your
mother in the garden, and sit with her on half-holidays, and she's
awfully good to you. I advise you to be one of Amy Wynne's children if
you can." She was interrupted by the loud ringing of a bell in the hall.
"That's for tea," Rosa added. "Come, and I'll show you the way."</p>

<p>The big dining-room was downstairs in the basement, next the kitchen.
Miss Clifford dined in the next room attended by her maids of honour
(the two girls at the top of the first class for the time being) and the
rest of the class except the girls at the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
 bottom, who were degraded to
the second-class table in the big dining-room. Here each two classes had
a separate table, at either end of which a teacher sat on a Windsor
chair. The girls had nothing but hard benches without backs to sit on.
Miss Bey, the housekeeper Miss Winch, and the head music-mistress,
irreverently called Old Tom by the girls, sat at a separate table,
where, at dinner-time, they did all the carving, and snatched what
little dinner they could get in the intervals, patiently and foolishly
regardless of their own digestions. For tea there were great dishes of
thick bread and butter on all the tables, which the girls began to hand
round as soon as grace had been said. Each class had a big basin of
brown sugar to put in the tea, which gave it a coarse flavour. The first
cup was not so bad, but the second was nothing but hot water poured
through the teapot. It was not etiquette to take more than two. When the
girls were ready for a second, they put pieces of bread in their saucers
that they might know their own again, and passed the cups up to the
teacher who poured out tea. If any girl suspected that the cup returned
to her was not her own, she would not touch the tea. When the meal was
over, one of the girls took the sugar-basin, beat down the sugar in it
flat and hard with the spoon, did a design on the top, and put it away.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"That's so that we shall know our own again," Rosa answered. "But it
never lasts the proper time."</p>

<p>"What do you do when it's done?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Do without," was the laconic rejoinder.</p>

<p>All the girls were talking at once.</p>

<p>"What a racket!" Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It'll be quiet enough to-morrow," Rosa replied. "The first class talks
at table in Miss Clifford's room, but we are not allowed to speak a word
here, except to the teachers, nor in the bedrooms either, once work
begins. Do you see that great fat old thing at the mistress's table?
That's Old Tom, the head music-mistress. She is a greedy old cat! She
likes eating! You can see it by the way she gloats over things, and
she's quite put out if she doesn't get exactly what she wants. Fancy
caring! It's just like a man; and that's why she's called Old Tom."</p>

<p>"Not that she's fastidious!" said Agnes Stewart, a tall slender girl
with short crisp black hair and grey-green eyes, who was sitting
opposite to Beth. "I believe she likes mutton."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's horrid enough for anything!" the girl next her exclaimed with
an expression of disgust.</p>

<p>Some of the girls ate their thick bread and butter unconcernedly, others
were choked with tears, and could not touch it. Most of the tearful ones
were new girls, and the old ones were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
 kind to them; the teachers, too,
were sympathetic, and did their best to cheer them.</p>

<p>After tea they all returned to their class-rooms. Beth went and stood in
one of the great windows looking out on to the grounds, the river, the
old arched bridge, and the grey houses of the town climbing up the hill
among the autumn-tinted trees. All the windows were shut, and she began
to feel suffocated for want of fresh air, and bewildered by the clatter
of voices. If only she could get out into the garden! The door at the
end of the room, which led into the first and second, was open. She went
through. But before she was half across the room, one of the elder girls
exclaimed roughly, "Hello! what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"It's a new girl, Inkie," another put in.</p>

<p>"Well, the sooner she learns she has no business here the better," Inkie
rejoined.</p>

<p>Beth thought her exceedingly rude, and passed on into the vestibule
unconcernedly.</p>

<p>"Well, that's cool cheek!" Inkie exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Hie&mdash;you&mdash;new girl! come back here directly, and go round the other
way, just to teach you manners."</p>

<p>Beth turned back with flaming cheeks, looked at her hard a moment.</p>

<p>"That for <i>your</i> manners!" she said, snapping her fingers at her.</p>

<p>Amy Wynne rose from her seat and went up to Beth. "You must learn at
once, Miss Caldwell," she said, "that you will not be allowed to speak
to the elder girls like that."</p>

<p>"Then the elder girls had better learn at once," said Beth defiantly,
"that they will not be allowed to speak to me as your Inkie-person did
just now. You'll not teach me manners by being rude to me; and if any
girl in the school is ever rude to me again, I'll box her ears. Now, I
apologise for coming through your room, but you should keep the door
shut."</p>

<p>When she had spoken, she returned to the big class-room deliberately,
and crossed it to the other door. As she did so, she noticed that a
strange hush had fallen upon the girls, and they were all looking at her
curiously. She went into the hall, and was passing the vestibule door,
when Miss Bey, who was sitting just inside knitting, stopped her.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Miss Caldwell?" she asked in her sharp way.</p>

<p>"Upstairs," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"You speak shortly, Miss Caldwell. It would have been more polite to
have mentioned my name."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Bey," Beth rejoined.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Bey bowed with a severe smile in acknowledgment of the apology.
"What do you want upstairs?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To be alone," Beth answered. "I can't stand the noise."</p>

<p>"You must stand the noise," said Miss Bey. "Girls are not allowed to go
upstairs without some very good reason; and they must always ask
permission&mdash;politely&mdash;from the teacher on duty. I am the teacher on duty
at this moment. If you had gone upstairs without permission, I should
have given you a bad mark."</p>

<p>Beth looked longingly at the hall door, which had glass panels in the
upper part, through which she could see the river and the trees. "What a
prison this is!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Miss Bey had had great experience of girls, and her sharp manner, which
was mainly acquired in the effort to maintain discipline, somewhat
belied her kindly nature.</p>

<p>"You can bring a chair from the hall, and sit here beside me, if you
like," she said to Beth.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Beth answered. "This <i>is</i> better," she said when she was
seated. "May I talk to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said Miss Bey.</p>

<p>There was a great conservatory behind them as they sat looking into the
hall; on their left was the third and fourth class-room, on their right
the first and second; the doors of both stood open.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the row I had in there just now?" Beth asked, nodding
towards the first and second.</p>

<p>"I did," said Miss Bey. "But you mustn't say 'row,' it is vulgar."</p>

<p>"Difficulty, then," Beth rejoined. "But what did you think of it?"</p>

<p>Miss Bey reflected. The question as Beth put it was not easy to answer.
"I thought you were both very much in the wrong," she said at last.</p>

<p>"Well, that is fair, at all events," Beth observed with approval. "I
don't mean to break any of your rules when I know what they are, and I
bet you I won't have a bad mark, if there's any way to help it, the
whole time I am at school; but I'm not going to be sat upon by anybody."</p>

<p>Miss Bey pursed up her mouth and knitted emphatically. She was
accustomed to naughty girls, but the most troublesome stood in awe of
the teachers.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, after a little pause, "I honour your good
resolutions; but I must request you not to say 'I'll bet,' or talk about
'being sat upon.' Both expressions are distinctly unladylike. I must
also tell you that at school the teachers are not on the same level as
the girls; they are in authority, you see."</p>

<p>"I see," said Beth. "I spoke to you as one lady might speak to another.
I won't again, Miss Bey."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Bey paused once more, with bent brows, to reflect upon this
ambiguous announcement; but not being able to make anything of it, she
proceeded: "It is a matter of discipline. Without strict discipline an
establishment of this size would be in a state of chaos. The girls must
respect the teachers, and the younger girls must respect the elder ones.
All become elder ones in turn, and are respected."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> mean to be respected all through," Beth declared, and set her
mouth hard on the determination.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock Miss Bey rang a big handbell for prayers, and the whole
household, including the servants, came trooping into the hall. The
girls sat together in their classes, and, when all were in their places,
Miss Clifford came in attended by her maids-of-honour, mounted the
reading-desk, and read the little service in a beautiful voice devoutly.
Beth softened as she listened, and joined in with all her heart towards
the end.</p>

<p>When prayers were over, and the servants had gone downstairs, one of the
maids-of-honour set a chair under the domed ceiling in front of the
vestibule for Miss Clifford, who went to it from the reading-desk, and
sat there. Then the first-class girls rose and left their seats in
single file, and each as she passed walked up to Miss Clifford, took the
hand which she held out, and curtsied good-night to her. The other
classes followed in the same order. Miss Clifford said a word or two to
some of the girls, and had a smile for all. When Beth's turn came, she
made an awkward curtsey in imitation of the others. Miss Clifford held
her hand a moment, and looked up into her face keenly; then smiled, and
let her go. Beth felt that there was some special thought behind that
smile, and wondered what it was. Miss Clifford made it her duty to know
the character, temper, constitution, and capacity of every one of the
eighty girls under her, and watched carefully for every change in them.
This good-night, which was a dignified and impressive ceremony, gave her
an opportunity of inspecting each girl separately every day, and very
little escaped her. If a girl looked unhappy, run down, overworked, or
otherwise out of sorts, Miss Clifford sent for her next morning to find
out what was the matter; and she was scolded, comforted, put on extras,
had a tonic to take, or was allowed another hour in bed in the morning,
according to the necessities of her case.</p>

<p>The girls who were in certain bedrooms sat up an hour after prayers, and
had dry bread and water for supper; they turned to the left and went
back to their class-rooms when they had made their curtseys. The others
turned to the right and went upstairs. Beth was one of these. She was in
No. 6. There were several beds in the room, and beside each bed was a
washstand, and a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
 box for clothes. The floor was carpetless. There were
white curtains hung on iron rods to be drawn round the beds and the
space beside them, so that each girl had perfect privacy to dress and
undress. The curtains were all drawn back for air when the girls were
ready, but no girl drew her curtain without the permission of the girl
next to her. When a bell rang, they all knelt down, and had ten minutes
for private prayers night and morning, the bell being rung again when
the time was up. The girls had to turn down their beds to air them
before they left their rooms in the morning. They had an hour's lessons
before breakfast, then prayers. After prayers the monitresses rose from
their seats below the reading-desk, and, as they filed out, each in turn
reported if any one had spoken or not spoken in the bedrooms. Breakfast
consisted of thick bread and butter and tea for the girls, with the
addition of an insufficient quantity of fried bacon for the teachers.
After breakfast the girls went upstairs again and made their beds in a
given time; then all but a few, who were kept in for music, went out
into the garden for half-an-hour. Beth had to go out that first morning.
The sun was shining, bright drops sparkled on grass and trees, the air
was heavy with autumn odours, but fresh and sweet, and the birds chirped
blithely. Beth felt like a free creature once more directly she got out,
and, throwing up her arms with a great exclamation of relief after the
restraint indoors, she ran out on to the wide grass-plot in front of the
house at the top of her speed.</p>

<p>"Come back, come back, new girl!" cried the head French mistress,
Mademoiselle Duval, the teacher on duty. "You are not allowed to go on
the grass, nor must you run in that unseemly way."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Beth. "I didn't know."</p>

<p>She moved off on to the path which overlooked the river, and began to
walk soberly up and down, gazing at the water.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle!" the French mistress screamed again shrilly, "come away
from there! The girls are not allowed to walk on that path."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Beth. "Where may I go?"</p>

<p>"Just go where you see the other girls go," Mademoiselle rejoined
sharply.</p>

<p>Not being a favourite, the French mistress was left to wander about
alone. Popular teachers always had some girls hanging on to their arms
out in the garden, and sitting with them when they were on duty indoors;
but Mademoiselle seldom had a satellite, and never one who was
respected. The girls thought her deceitful, and deceit was one of the
things not tolerated in the school. Miss Bey was believed to be above
deceit of any kind, and was liked and respected accordingly in spite of
her angular appearance,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
 sharp manner, the certainty that she was not a
lady by birth, and the suspicion that her father kept a shop. The girls
had certain simple tests of character and station. They attend more to
each other's manners in the matter of nicety at girls' schools than at
boys', more's the pity for those who have to live with the boys
afterwards. If a new girl drank with her mouth full, ate audibly, took
things from the end instead of the side of a spoon, or bit her bread
instead of breaking it at dinner, she was set down as nothing much at
home, which meant that her people were socially of no importance, not to
say common; and if she were not perfectly frank and honest, or if she
ever said coarse or indelicate things, she was spoken of contemptuously
as a dockyard girl, which meant one of low mind and objectionable
manners, who was in a bad set at home and made herself cheap after the
manner of a garrison hack, the terms being nearly equivalent. There was
no pretence of impossible innocence among the elder girls, but neither
was there any impropriety of language or immodesty of conduct. Certain
subjects were avoided, and if a girl made any allusion to them by
chance, she was promptly silenced; if she recurred to them persistently,
she was set down at once as a dockyard girl and an outsider. The
consequence of this high standard was an extremely good tone all through
the school.</p>

<p>Beth turned into the lime-tree avenue, where she met several sets of
girls all walking in rows with their arms round each other. None of them
took any notice of her, until she got out on to the drive, where she met
Amy Wynne with her children. Amy let go the two she had her arms round,
sent them all on, and stopped to speak to Beth.</p>

<p>"Have you no mother?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have one at home," Beth answered coldly in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"But you know our custom here," Amy rejoined. "The elder girls are
mothers to the young ones."</p>

<p>"I know," said Beth, "but I don't want a mother. I should hate to have
my thoughts interrupted by a lot of little girls in a row, all cackling
together."</p>

<p>"I was going to offer," Amy began, "but, of course, if you are so
self-reliant, it would only be an impertinence."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" said Beth, sincerely regretting her own ungraciousness. "It is
kind of you, and if it were you alone, I should be glad, but I could not
stand the others."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you won't be lonely," Amy answered, and hurried on after
her children.</p>

<p>"Lonely I must be," Beth muttered to herself with sudden foreboding.</p>

<p>When the girls went in, Beth was summoned to the big music-room. "Old
Tom" was there with Dr. Centry, who came twice

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
 a week to hear the girls
play. There were twelve pianos in the room, ten upright and two grand,
besides Old Tom's own private grand, all old, hard, and metallic; and
twelve girls hammered away on them, all together, at the same piece; but
if one made a mistake, Old Tom instantly detected it, and knew which it
was.</p>

<p>"Do ye know any music?" she asked Beth in a gruff voice with a rough
Scotch accent.</p>

<p>"A little," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"What, for instance?" Old Tom pursued, looking at Beth as if she were a
culprit up for judgment.</p>

<p>"Some of Chopin," Beth replied. "I like him best."</p>

<p>Old Tom raised her eyebrows incredulously. "Sit down here and play one
of his compositions, if you please&mdash;here, at my piano," she said,
opening the instrument.</p>

<p>But Beth felt intimidated for once, partly by the offensive manners of
the formidable-looking old woman, her bulk and gruffness, but also
because Old Tom's doubt of her powers, which she perceived, was shaking
her confidence. She sat down at the piano, however, and struck a few
notes; then her nerve forsook her.</p>

<p>"I can't play," she said. "I'm nervous."</p>

<p>"Humph!" snarled Old Tom. "I thought that 'ud be your Chopin! Go and
learn exercises with the children in Miss Tait's class-room."</p>

<p>Miss Tait, acting on Old Tom's report, put Beth into one of her lower
classes, and left her to practise with the beginners. When she had gone,
Beth glanced at the exercises, and then began to rattle them off at such
a rate that no one in the class could keep up with her. Miss Tait came
hurrying back.</p>

<p>"Who is that playing so fast?" she said. "Was it you, Miss Caldwell?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Then you must go into a higher class," said Miss Tait.</p>

<p>But the same thing happened in every class until at last Beth had run up
through them all, as up a flight of stairs, into Old Tom's first. Her
piano in the first, when the whole class was present and she had no
choice, was a hard old instrument, usually avoided because it was the
nearest to the table at which Old Tom sat (when she did not walk about)
during a lesson. The first time Beth took her place at it, the other
girls were only beginning to assemble, and Old Tom was not in the room.
A great teasing of instruments, as Old Tom called it, was going on. A
new piece was to be taken that morning, and each girl began to try it as
soon as she sat down, so that they were all at different passages. They
stopped, however, and looked up when Beth appeared.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's your piano," the head girl said.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll like it!" one of the others added sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm glad to be here!" said Beth, striking a few firm chords.
"Now I feel like Chopin," and she burst out into one of his most
brilliant waltzes triumphantly.</p>

<p>Old Tom had come in while she was speaking, but Beth did not see her.
Old Tom waited till she had done.</p>

<p>"Oh, so now ye feel like Chopin, Miss Caldwell," she jeered. "And it
appears ye are not above shamming nervous when it suits ye to mak'
yerself interesting. I shall remember that."</p>

<p>Old Tom taught by a series of jeers and insults. If a girl were poor,
she never failed to remind her of the fact. "But, indeed, ye're beggars
all," was her favourite summing up when they stumbled at troublesome
passages. Most of the girls cowered under her insults, but Beth looked
her straight in the face at this second encounter, and at the third her
spirit rose and she argued the point. Old Tom tried to shout her down,
but Beth left her seat, and suggested that they should go and get Miss
Clifford to decide between them. Then Old Tom subsided, and from that
time she and Beth were on amicable terms.</p>

<p>Beth had an excellent musical memory when she went to school, but she
lost it entirely whilst she was there, and the delicacy of her touch as
well; both being destroyed, as she supposed, by the system of practising
with so many others at a time, which made it impossible for her to feel
what she was playing or put any individuality of expression into it.</p>

<p>On that opening day, Beth had to go from the music-room to her first
English lesson in the sixth. All the girls sat round the long narrow
table, Miss Smallwood, the mistress, being at the end, with her back to
the window. The lesson was "Guy," a collection of questions and answers,
used also by the first-class girls, only that they were farther on in
the book. Who was William the Conqueror? When did he arrive? What did he
do on landing? and so on. Beth, at the bottom of the class on Miss
Smallwood's right, was in a good position to ask questions herself. She
could have told the whole history of William the Conqueror in her own
language after once reading it over; but the answers to the questions
had to be learnt by heart and repeated in the exact language of the
book, and in the struggle to be word-perfect enough to keep up with the
class, the significance of what she was saying was lost upon her. It was
her mother's system exactly, and Beth was disappointed, having hoped for
something different These pillules of knowledge only exasperated her;
she wanted enough to enable her to grasp the whole situation.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the use of learning these little bits by heart about William
the Conqueror and the battle of Hastings, and all that, Miss Smallwood?"
she exclaimed one day.</p>

<p>"It is a part of your education, Beth," Miss Smallwood answered
precisely.</p>

<p>"I know," Beth grumbled, "but couldn't one read about it, and get on a
little quicker? I want to know what he did when he got here."</p>

<p>"Why, my dear child, how can you be so stupid? You have just said he
fought the battle of Hastings."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what did the battle of Hastings do?" Beth persisted, making a
hard but ineffectual effort to express herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Beth, you are silly!" Miss Smallwood rejoined impatiently, and
all the girls grinned in agreement. But it was not Beth who was silly.
Miss Smallwood had had nothing herself but the trumpery education
provided everywhere at that time for girls by the part of humanity which
laid undisputed claim to a superior sense of justice, and it had not
carried her far enough to enable her to grasp any more comprehensive
result of the battle of Hastings than was given in the simple philosophy
of Guy. Most of the girls at the Royal Service School would have to work
for themselves, and teaching was almost the only occupation open to
them, yet such education as they received, consisting as it did of mere
rudiments, was an insult to the high average of intelligence that
obtained amongst them. They were not taught one thing thoroughly, not
even their own language, and remained handicapped to the end of their
lives for want of a grounding in grammar. When you find a woman's
diction at fault, never gird at her for want of intelligence, but at
those in authority over her in her youth, who thought anything in the
way of education good enough for a girl. Even the teachers at St.
Catherine's, some of them, wrote in reply to invitations, "I shall have
much pleasure in accepting." The girls might be there eight years, but
were never taught French enough in the time either to read or speak it
correctly. Their music was an offence to the ear, and their drawings to
the eye. History was given to them in outlines only, which isolated
kings and their ministers, showing little or nothing of their influence
on the times they lived in, and ignoring the condition of the people,
who were merely introduced as a background to some telling incident in
the career of a picturesque personage; and everything else was taught in
the same superficial way&mdash;except religion. But the fact that the
religious education was good in Beth's time was an accident due to Miss
Clifford's character and capacity, and therefore no credit to the
governors of the school, who did not know that she was specially
qualified in that respect

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
 when they made her Lady Principal. She was a
high-minded woman, Low Church, of great force of character and exemplary
piety, and her spirit pervaded the whole school. She gave the Bible
lessons herself in the form of lectures which dealt largely with the
conduct of life; and as she had the power to make her subject
interesting, and the faith which carries conviction, both girls and
mistresses profited greatly by her teaching. Many of them became deeply
religious under her, and most of them had phases of piety; whilst there
were very few who did not leave the school with yearnings at least
towards honour and uprightness, which were formed by time and experience
into steady principles.</p>

<p>Beth persisted in roaming the garden alone. She loved to hover about a
large fountain there, with a deep wide basin round it, in which
gold-fish swam and water-lilies grew. She used to go and hang over it,
peering into the water, or, when the fountain played, she would loiter
near, delighting in the sound of it, the splash and murmur.</p>

<p>One of the windows of Miss Clifford's sitting-room overlooked this part
of the garden, and Beth noticed the old lady once or twice standing in
the window, but it did not occur to her that she was watching her. One
day, however, Miss Clifford sent a maid-of-honour to fetch her; and Beth
went in, wondering what she had done, but asked no questions; calm
indifference was still her pose.</p>

<p>Miss Clifford dismissed the maid-of-honour. She was sitting in her own
special easy-chair, and Beth stood before her.</p>

<p>"My dear child," she said to Beth, "why are you always alone? Are the
girls not kind to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, thank you," Beth answered, "they are quite kind."</p>

<p>"Then why are you always alone?"</p>

<p>"I like it best."</p>

<p>"Are you sure," said Miss Clifford, "that the others do not shun you for
some reason or other?"</p>

<p>"One of them wished to be my mother," Beth rejoined, "but I did not care
about it."</p>

<p>"But you cannot be happy always alone like that," Miss Clifford
observed.</p>

<p>Beth was silent.</p>

<p>Miss Clifford looked at her earnestly for a little, then she shook her
head.</p>

<p>"I tell you what I will do if you like, Miss Clifford," Beth said upon
reflection. "I will form a family of my own."</p>

<p>Miss Clifford smiled. "Ah! I see you are ambitious," she said, "but, my
dear child, a sixth girl can't expect to have that kind of influence."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not ambition," Beth answered, "for I shall feel it no
distinction, only a great bother. Nevertheless, I will do it to show you
that I am not shunned; and to please you, as you do not like me to
wander alone."</p>

<p>A week or two later Beth appeared in the garden with six of the worst
girls in the school clinging to her, fascinated by her marvellous talk.</p>

<p>Miss Clifford sent for her again. "I am sorry to see you in such
company," she said. "Those girls are all older than you are, and they
will lead you into mischief."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Miss Clifford," Beth replied, "I shall keep them out
of mischief. Not one of them has had a bad mark this week."</p>

<p>Then Miss Clifford sent for Miss Smallwood, the mistress of the sixth.
"What do you make of Beth Caldwell?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I can't make anything of her," Miss Smallwood answered. "I think she
tries, but she does not seem able to keep up with the other girls at
all. She seldom knows a lesson or does a sum correctly. I sometimes
think she ought to be in the eighth. But then occasionally she shows a
knowledge far beyond her years; not a knowledge of school work, but of
books and life."</p>

<p>"How about her themes?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think of them; they are too good. But she declares
emphatically that she does them all out of her own head."</p>

<p>"What sort of temper has she?"</p>

<p>"Queer, like everything else about her. Not unamiable, you know, but
irritable at times, and she has days of deep depression, and moments of
extreme elation."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Miss Clifford ejaculated, and then reflected a little. "Well, be
patient with her," she said at last. "If she hasn't exceptional ability
of some kind, I am no judge of girls; but she is evidently unaccustomed
to school work, and is suffering from the routine and restraint, after
being allowed to run wild. She should have been sent here years ago."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the foregoing it will be seen that Beth made her mark upon the
school from the day of her arrival in the way of getting herself
observed and talked about. She was set down as queer to begin with, and
when lessons began both girls and mistresses decided that she was
stupid; and queer she remained to the end in the estimation of those who
had no better word to express it, but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
 with regard to her stupidity
there soon began to be differences of opinion.</p>

<p>At preparation one evening she talked instead of doing her work, and
gradually all the girls about her had stopped to listen.</p>

<p>"Gracious!" Beth exclaimed at last, "the bell will go directly, and I've
not done a sum. Show me how to work them, Rosa."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" Rosa rejoined. "Find out for yourself! My theme was
turned, and I've got to do it again."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Beth, "if you'll do my sums, I'll do your theme now,
and your thorough bass on Thursday."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness you wouldn't talk, Beth!" Agnes Stewart exclaimed.
"We shall all get bad marks to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then why do you listen?" Beth retorted.</p>

<p>"I can't help it," Agnes grumbled. "You fascinate me. I should have
thought you were clever if I had only heard you talk, and not known what
a duffer you are at your lessons."</p>

<p>"Well, she's not a duffer at thorough bass anyway," Rosa put in. "She
only began this term, and she's a long way ahead even of some of the
first. Old Tom's given her a little book to herself."</p>

<p>"I began thorough bass with the rest of you," Beth observed. "It's the
only thing we started fair in. You are years ahead of me in all the
other work."</p>

<p>The girls reflected upon this for a little.</p>

<p>"And you can write themes," Rosa finally asseverated.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," Beth protested. "Themes are easy enough. I could
write them for the whole school."</p>

<p>"Well, that's no reason why you should put your nose in your cup every
time you drink," Lucy Black, the sharpest shrimp of a girl in the class,
said, grinning.</p>

<p>"I never did such a thing in my life," Beth exclaimed, turning crimson.
"You'll say I eat audibly next."</p>

<p>"No, you don't do that," Rosa said solemnly; "but you do put your nose
in your cup."</p>

<p>The colour flickered on Beth's sensitive cheek, and she shrank into
herself.</p>

<p>"There, don't tease her!" Mary Wright, the eldest, stupidest, and most
motherly girl in the school, exclaimed. "How can you drink without
putting your nose in your cup, stupid?"</p>

<p>Then Beth saw it and smiled, greatly relieved. This venerable pleasantry
was a sign that she had been taken once for all into the good graces of
her schoolmates. The girls who were liked were usually nicknamed and
always chaffed; the rest were treated with different degrees of
politeness, the dockyard girls, as the lowest of all, being called miss,
even by the teachers.</p>

<p>On Thursday evenings the girls in the fifth and sixth were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span> allowed to
do fancy work for an hour while a story-book was read aloud to them,
either by Miss Smallwood or one of themselves when her voice was tired.
The book was always either childish or dull, generally both, and Beth,
who had been accustomed to Scott, Dickens, and Thackeray, grew restive
under the infliction. One evening when she had twice been reprimanded
for yawning aggressively, she exclaimed, "Well, Miss Smallwood, it is
such silly stuff! Why, I could tell you a better story myself, and make
it up as I go on."</p>

<p>"Then begin at once and tell it," said Miss Smallwood, glancing round at
the girls, who smiled derisively, thinking that Beth would have to
excuse herself and thereby tacitly acknowledge that she had been
boasting. To their surprise, however, Beth took the request seriously,
settled herself in her chair, folded her hands, and, with her eyes
roaming about the room as if she were picking up the details from the
walls, the floor, the ceiling, and all it contained, started without
hesitation. It was the romantic story of a haunted house on a great
rocky promontory, and the freshness and sound of the sea pervaded it.
The girls went on with their work for a little, but by degrees first one
and then another stopped, and just sat staring at Beth, while gravity
settled on every face as the interest deepened.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bell rang, and the story was not finished.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" Miss Smallwood exclaimed, "it is very fascinating, Beth; but
I really am afraid I ought not to have allowed you to tell it. I had no
idea&mdash;I must speak to Miss Clifford."</p>

<p>The fame of this wonderful story spread through the school, and the next
half-holiday the first-class girls sent to ask Beth to go to their room
and repeat it; but Beth was not in the mood, and answered their
messenger tragically:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas not for this I left my father's home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, tell your class, that Vashti will not come."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Vashti's a little beast, I think," the head girl observed when the
message was delivered.</p>

<p>Miss Clifford also sent for Beth, and requested her to repeat the story,
that she might judge for herself if she should be allowed to go on with
it; and Beth repeated it, being constrained; but the recital was so
wearisome that Miss Clifford dismissed her before she was half-way
through, with leave to finish it if anybody cared to hear it. When
Thursday came, the girls and Miss Smallwood cared very much to hear it,
and Beth, stimulated by their clamours, went on without a break for the
whole hour, and ended with a description of a shipwreck, which was so
vivid that the whole class was shaken with awe, and sat silent for a
perceptible time after she stopped.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth could rarely be persuaded to repeat this performance; but from that
time her standing was unique, both with girls and mistresses, a fact,
however, of which she herself was totally unaware. She felt her
backwardness in school work and nothing else, and petitioned God
incessantly to help her with her lessons, and get her put up; and put up
she was regularly until she reached the third, when she was among the
elder girls. She was never able to do the work properly of any class she
was in, however, and her class mistresses were always against her being
put up, but Miss Clifford insisted on it.</p>

<p>Beth was never anything but miserable at school. The dull routine of the
place pressed heavily upon her, and everything she had to do was
irksome. The other girls accommodated themselves more or less
successfully to the circumstances of their lives; but Beth in herself
was always at war with her surroundings, and her busy brain teemed with
ingenious devices to vary the monotony. The confinement, want of
relaxation, and of proper physical training, very soon told upon her
health and spirits, as indeed they did upon the greater number of the
girls, who suffered unnecessarily in various ways. Beth very soon had to
have an extra hour in bed in the morning, a cup of soup at eleven
o'clock, a tonic three times a day, and a slice of thick bread and
butter with a glass of stout on going to bed; such things were not
stinted during Miss Clifford's administration; but it was a case of
treating effects which all the time were being renewed by causes that
might and ought to have been removed, but were let alone.</p>

<p>St. Catherine's Mansion was regulated on a system of exemplary dulness.
There is a certain dowager still extant who considers it absurd to
provide amusement for people of inferior station. All people who earn
their living are people of inferior station to her; she has never heard
of such a thing as the dignity of labour. Because many of the girls at
St. Catherine's were orphans without means, and would therefore have to
earn their own living as governesses when their education was finished,
the dowager-persons who interested themselves in the management of the
school had used their influence strenuously to make the life there as
much of a punishment as possible. "You cannot be too strict with girls
in their position," was what they continually averred, their own
position by birth being in no way better, and in some instances not so
good, as that of the girls whom they were depriving of every innocent
pleasure natural to their age and necessary for the good of their health
and spirits. They were not allowed to learn dancing; they had no outdoor
games at all, not even croquet&mdash;nothing whatever to exhilarate them and
develop them physically except an hour's "deportment,"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> the very mildest
kind of calisthenics, in the big class-room once a fortnight, and the
daily making of their little beds. For the rest, monotonous walks up and
down the garden-paths in small parties, or about the dreary roads two
and two in long lines, was their only exercise, and even in this they
were restricted to such a severe propriety of demeanour that it almost
seemed as if the object were to teach them to move without betraying the
fact that they had legs. The consequence of all this restraint was a low
state of vitality among the girls, and the outbreak of morbid phases
that sometimes went right through the school. Beth, as might have been
expected, was one of the first to be caught by anything of this kind;
and she arrived, by way of her own emotions, at the cause of a great
deal that was a mystery to older people, and also thought out the cure
eventually; but she suffered a great deal in the process of acquiring
her special knowledge of the subject. She was especially troubled by her
old malady&mdash;depression of spirits. Sometimes, on a summer evening, when
all the classes were at preparation, and the whole great house was
still, a mistress would begin to practise in one of the music-rooms, and
Beth would be carried away by the music, so that work was impossible.
One evening, when this happened, she sat, with a very sad face, looking
out on the river. Pleasure-boats were gliding up and down; a gay party
went by, dancing on the deck of a luxurious barge to the music of a
string-band; a young man skimmed the surface in a skiff, another punted
two girls along; and people walked on the banks or sat about under the
trees, and children played&mdash;and they were all free! Suddenly Beth burst
into tears. Miss Smallwood questioned her. Was she ill? had she any
pain? had any one been unkind to her? No? What was the matter then?
Nothing; she was just miserable!</p>

<p>"Beth, don't be so silly," Miss Smallwood remonstrated. "A great girl
like you, crying for nothing! It is positively childish."</p>

<p>The other girls stole glances at her and looked grave. At the beginning
of the term they would not have sympathised perhaps; but this was the
middle, and many of them were in much the same mood themselves.</p>

<p>When the bell rang, and the recreation hour began, they got out their
little bits of fancy-work, and such dull childish books as they were
allowed, and broke up into groups. Beth was soon surrounded by the
cleverer girls in the class.</p>

<p>"I sympathise with you, Beth," said Janey North, a red-haired Irish
girl, "for I felt like it myself, I did indeed."</p>

<p>"Will the holidays never be here?" sighed Rosa Bird.</p>

<p>"I can't think why I stay at all," said Beth. "I hate it&mdash;I hate it all
the time."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how could one get away?" said Janey.</p>

<p>"Only by being ill," Agnes Stewart answered darkly. She was a delicate
girl, and from that time she starved herself resolutely, until she was
so wasted that Miss Clifford in despair sent her home. Another girl was
seized with total deafness suddenly, and had also to go; the change
brought her hearing back in a very short time; and some of the dockyard
girls received urgent summonses from dying relations, and were allowed
to go to them. They always returned the brighter for the experience.</p>

<p>One day, after the weather became cold, a girl appeared in class wrapped
up in a shawl, and with her head all drawn down to one side. Her neck
was stiff, and she could not straighten it. She was sent to the
infirmary. The girls thought her lucky. For it was warm there, and nurse
was kind, and sang delightful songs. She would be able to do fancy-work,
too, and read as much as she liked, and would not have to get up till
she had had her breakfast and the fire was lighted, and need not trouble
about lessons at all&mdash;a stiff neck was a very small drawback to the
delights of such a change.</p>

<p>Next day another girl's neck was stiff. Miss Smallwood searched for a
draught, but did not succeed in finding one. That evening at prayers one
of the girls in the first appeared in a shawl with her head on one side
and a white worn face; and next day there was another case from the
third and fourth. So it was evident that there was something like an
epidemic going through the school; but the doctor had never seen one of
the kind before, and was at a loss to account for it. The cases were all
exactly alike: stiff neck, with the head drawn down to one side,
accompanied by feverishness, and followed by severe prostration.</p>

<p>Beth sat with a stolid countenance, and stared solemnly at every girl
that was attacked, as if she were studying her case. Then, one morning,
she came down in a shawl herself, with her head on one side and a very
white face. Nurse marched her off at once to the infirmary, and put her
in a bed beside the fire, and Beth, as she coiled herself up, and
realised that she need not worry about lessons, or rush off to practise
when the bell rang, or go out to walk up and down in the garden till she
hated every pebble on the path, heaved a great sigh of relief and fell
asleep. When she awoke the doctor was feeling her pulse.</p>

<p>"She's very low," he said. "Is she a delicate girl naturally?"</p>

<p>"She looked strong enough when she came to school," nurse answered; "but
she soon went off, as so many of them do."</p>

<p>"The loss of vitality amongst them is really extraordinary," the doctor
observed. "Give her port wine and beef-tea. Don't keep her in bed too
much, but don't hurry her up. Rest and relief from lessons is the great
thing."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Some healthy pleasure to vary the monotonous routine, some liberty of
action and something to look forward to, would have been better; but
nobody thought of that.</p>

<p>How many of those necks were really stiff beyond the will of the
sufferer to move it, no one will ever know; but when it occurred to Beth
to straighten her own one day, she found no difficulty.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Beth was moved into the upper school, she came under the direct
influence of Miss Crow, the English mistress of the third and fourth,
who had been educated at St. Catherine's herself, and was an ardent
disciple of Miss Clifford's. Beth, although predisposed to pietism, had
not been sensibly influenced by Miss Clifford's teaching heretofore;
now, however, she attached herself to Miss Crow, who began at once to
take a special interest in her spiritual welfare. She encouraged Beth to
sit and walk with her when she was on duty, and invited her to her room
during recreation in order to talk to her earnestly on the subject of
salvation, or to read to her and expound portions of Scripture, fine
passages from religious books, and beautiful hymns. Some of the hymns
she took the trouble to copy out for Beth's help and comfort when they
were specially appropriate to the needs of her nature, such as "Calm me,
my God, and keep me calm," or specially suited to her case, like "Call
me! and I will answer, gladly singing!" Beth responded readily to her
kindness, and very soon became a convert to her views; but she did not
stop there, for it was not in Beth's nature to rest content with her own
conversion while there were so many others still sitting in darkness who
might be brought to the light. No sooner was she convinced herself than
she began to proselytise among the other girls, and in a short time her
eloquence and force of character attracted a following from all parts of
the school. Miss Crow told Miss Clifford that she spoke like one
inspired, and high hopes were entertained of the work which they
somewhat prematurely concluded she was destined to do. Unfortunately
Beth's fervent faith received a check at a critical time when it was
highly important to have kept it well nourished&mdash;that is to say, when
she was being prepared for confirmation. It happened when Miss Crow was
hearing the girls their Scripture lesson one morning, the subject being
the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt, and the destruction of
Pharaoh's hosts in the Red Sea.</p>

<p>"I know a man who says the whole of that account has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> been garbled,"
Beth remarked in a dreamy way, meaning Count Gustav Bartahlinsky, but
not thinking much of what she was saying.</p>

<p>Miss Crow nearly dropped the Bible, so greatly was she startled and
shocked by the announcement.</p>

<p>"Beth!" she exclaimed, directly the class was over and she could speak
to Beth privately, "how could you be so wicked as to say that anything
in Holy Scripture is a garbled account?"</p>

<p>"I said I knew a man who said so," Beth answered, surprised that so
simple a remark should have created such consternation.</p>

<p>But Miss Crow saw in her attitude a dangerous tendency to scepticism,
and expressed strong condemnation of any one who presumed to do other
than accept Holy Writ in blind unquestioning faith. She talked to Beth
with horror about the ungodly men who cast doubt on the unity of the
Bible, called its geology in question, and even ventured to correct its
chronology by the light of vain modern scientific discoveries; and Beth
shocked her again by the questions she asked, and the intelligent
interest she showed in the subject. She told Miss Crow that Count Gustav
had also said that the Old Testament was bad religion and worse history,
but she did not know that other people had thought so too. Whereupon
Miss Crow went to Miss Clifford and reported Beth's attitude as
something too serious for her to deal with alone, and Miss Clifford sent
for Beth and talked to her long and earnestly. She told her that it was
absurd for a girl of her age to call in question the teaching of the
best and greatest men that ever lived, which somehow reminded Beth of
the many mistakes made by the best and greatest men that ever lived, of
their differences of opinion and undignified squabbles, the instances of
one man discovering and suffering for a truth which the rest refused to
accept, and the constant modification, alteration, and rejection by one
generation of teaching which had been upheld by another with brutality
and bloodshed,&mdash;instances of all of which were notorious enough even to
be known at a girls' school. Beth said very little, however; but she
determined to read the Bible through from beginning to end, and see for
herself if she could detect any grounds for the mischief-making doubts
and controversies she had been hearing about. She began in full faith,
but was brought up short at the very outset by the discrepancy between
the first and second chapters of Genesis, which she perceived for the
first time. She went steadily on, however, until she had finished the
Book of Job, and then she paused in revolt. She could not reconcile the
dreadful experiment which had entailed unspeakable suffering and loss
irreparable upon a good man with any attribute she had been accustomed
to revere in her deity. There might be some

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
 explanation to excuse this
game of god and devil, but until she knew the excuse she would vow no
adhesion to a power whose conduct on that occasion seemed contrary to
every canon of justice and mercy. She did not belong to the servile age
when men, forgetting their manhood, fawned on patrons for what they
could get, and cringingly accepted favours from the dirtiest hands. Even
her God must be worthy to help her, worthy to be loved, good as well as
great. The God who connived at the torment of Job could not be the God
of her salvation.</p>

<p>Beth had spoken casually in class. She had never questioned her
religion, and would not have done so now if the remark had been allowed
to pass; but the fuss that was made about it, and the severity with
which she was rebuked, by putting her mind into a critical attitude, had
the effect of concentrating her attention on the subject; so that it was
the very precautions which were taken to check her supposed scepticism
that first made her sceptical. The immediate consequence was that she
gave up preaching and refused to be confirmed. Miss Clifford, Miss Crow,
and the chaplain argued, expostulated, and punished in vain. It was the
first case of the kind that had occurred in the school, and Beth was
treated as a criminal; but she felt more like a martyr, and was not to
be moved. She did not try to make partisans for herself, however; on the
contrary, she deserted her family as well as her congregation, and took
to wandering about alone again; but she was not unhappy. Her old faith
had gone, it is true, but it had left the way prepared for a new one.
She did not believe in the God of Job&mdash;because she was sure that there
must be a better God&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>From this time, however, her imagination rode rampant once more over
everything. The vision and the dream were upon her. All wholesome
interest in her work was over. There was an old piano in the
reception-room which the girls were allowed to use for their amusement
on half-holidays, and she often went there; but even when she practised,
she moved her fingers mechanically, her mind busy with vivid scenes and
moving dramatic incidents; so that her beloved music was gradually
converted from an object in itself into an aid to thought.</p>

<p>It was only six weeks to the holidays, but oh! how the days dragged! She
struggled to be conscientious, to be good, to please Miss Crow, to
escape bad marks; but everything was irksome. Getting up, lessons,
breakfast, making her bed, practising, lessons again, dressing, going
out, dinner&mdash;the whole round of regular life was an effort. Her face
grew thin and pale, she began to cough, and was put upon extras again.
"We can't let you go home looking like that, you know," nurse said. Beth
looked up at her out of her dream absently and smiled.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> She was enjoying
a visionary walk at the moment with a vague being who loved her. They
were out on a white cliff overlooking the sea in a wild warm region. The
turf they trod on was vivid green, and short and springy; the water
below was green and bright and clear, sea-birds skimmed the surface, and
the air was sweet. But presently the road was barred by a rail, so they
had to stop, and he put his arm round her, and she laid her head on his
shoulder; and the murmur of wind and water was in her ears, and she
became as the lark that sang above them, the curlew that piped, the
quiet cattle, and all inanimate things&mdash;untroubled, natural, complete.
All intellectual interest being suspended, she had begun to yearn for a
companion, a mate. Her delicate mind refused to account for the tender
sensation; but it was love, or rather the mood for love she had fallen
into&mdash;the passive mood, which can be converted into the active in an
ordinary young girl by almost any man of average attractions, provided
she is not already yearning happily for some one in particular. It is
not until much later that she learns to discriminate. There were girls
at the school who saw in every man they met a possible lover, and were
ready to accept any man who offered himself; but they were of coarser
fibre than Beth, more susceptible to the physical than to the ideal
demands of love, and fickle because the man who was present had more
power to please than the one who was merely a recollection. The actual
presence was enough for them, they had no ideals. With Beth it was
different. Her present was apt to be but a poor faded substitute for the
future with the infinite range of possibilities she had the power to
perceive in it, or even for the past as she glorified it.</p>

<p>While she was in this mood she was particularly provoking to those in
authority over her.</p>

<p>"Beth," said Miss Crow one day severely, "you are to go to Miss Clifford
directly." Beth went.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Miss Clifford in her severest tone, "that you have not
made your bed this morning."</p>

<p>"I went up to make it," Beth answered, trying dreamily to recollect what
had happened after that.</p>

<p>"I must give you a bad mark," Miss Clifford said, and then paused; and
Beth, who had not been attending, becoming conscious that something had
been bestowed upon her, answered politely, "Thank you."</p>

<p>"Beth, you are impertinent," Miss Clifford exclaimed, "and I must punish
you severely. Stay in the whole of your half-holiday and do arithmetic."</p>

<p>Then Beth awoke with a start, and realising what she had done, struggled
to explain; but the moment she became herself

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> again, an agony of
dumbness came upon her, and she left the room without a word.</p>

<p>She spent the long bright afternoon cowering over her arithmetic, and
crying at intervals, being in the lowest spirits, so that by prayer-time
she was pretty well exhausted. She tried to attend to the psalms, but in
the middle of them she became a poor girl suffering from a cruel sense
of injustice. All her friends misunderstood her and were unkind to her,
in consequence of which she pined away, and one day, in the midst of a
large party, she dropped down dead.</p>

<p>And at this point she actually did fall fainting with a thud on the
floor. Miss Clifford, who was giving out the hymn, stopped startled, and
some of the girls shrieked. Miss Crow and one of the other teachers
carried Beth out by the nearest door.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing!" said Miss Crow, looking pityingly at her drawn
white face and purple eyelids. "I'm afraid she's very delicate."</p>

<p>Miss Clifford came also, when prayers were over, and said kind things;
and from that time forward Beth received a great deal of sympathetic
attention, which did her good, but in no way reconciled her to her
imprisonment.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>The following term, Beth watched the spring come in at school with
infinite yearning. To be out&mdash;to be free to sit under the apple-trees
and look up through the boughs at the faintly flushed blossom, till the
vision and the dream came upon her, and she passed from conscious
thought into a higher phase of being&mdash;just to do that was her one desire
till the petals fell. Then pleasure-boats began to be rowed on the
river, rowed or steered by girls no older than herself, in summer
dresses delicately fresh; and she, seeing them, became aware of the
staleness of her own shabby clothing, and writhed under the rules which
would not allow her even to walk on the path overlooking the river, and
gaze her fill at it. The creamy white flowers of the great magnolia on
the lawn came out, and once she slipped across the grass to peer into
them and smell them. She got a bad mark for that, the second she had
had.</p>

<p>At preparation that evening she sat so that she could see the river, and
watched it idly instead of working; and presently there floated into her
mind the rhyme she made when she was a little child at Fairholm&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fairy folk are calling me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly she caught her breath, her cheeks flushed, her eyes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> sparkled,
her whole aspect changed from apathy to animation, and she laughed.</p>

<p>"What has happened to please you, Beth; you look quite bright?" Miss Bey
said, meeting her in the vestibule when preparation was over. Miss Bey
was said to favour Beth by some; Beth was said to toady Bey by others;
the truth being that they had taken to each other from the first, and
continued friends.</p>

<p>"I've got a sort of singing at my heart," Beth answered, sparkling. "The
fairy folk are calling me."</p>

<p>Beth slept in No. 5 then, and had the bed nearest to the window. There
was a moon that night, and she lay long watching the light of it upon
the blind&mdash;long after the gas was put out and the teachers had gone to
their rooms. Wondering at last if the girls in the room were asleep, she
sat up in bed, the better to be able to hear; and judged that they were.
Then she got out of bed, walked quietly down the room in her night-dress
and bare feet, opened the door cautiously, and found herself out in the
carpetless passage. It was dark there, but she walked on confidently to
the head of the grand staircase, which the girls were only allowed to
use on special occasions. "This <i>is</i> a special occasion," Beth said to
herself with a grin. "The fairy folk are calling me, and I must go out
and dance on the grass in that lovely moonlight."</p>

<p>But how to get out was the difficulty. The hall door was bolted and
barred. She went into the first and second. There were two large windows
in the room which looked into the great conservatory, and one of them
was open a crack. She pushed it up higher, and got through into the
conservatory. There she found a large side window on the left of the
first and second also open a little. The shelf in front of the window
had flower-pots on it, which she moved aside, then got up herself, and
with a tug, managed to raise the heavy sash. Then she sat on the sill
and looked down. It was too far to jump, but a sort of dado of
ornamental stonework came right up to the window, and by the help of
this she managed to descend to the ground, and found herself free. For a
moment she stood stretching herself like one just released from a
cramped position, drawing in deep draughts of the delicious night air
the while; then she bounded off over the dewy grass, and ran, and
jumped, and waved her arms, every muscle of her rejoicing in an ecstasy
of liberty. She ran round to the front of the house, regardless of the
chance of some one seeing her from one of the windows, and danced round
and round the magnolia, and buried her face in the big white flowers one
after the other, and bathed it in the dew on their petals. Then she went
to the path by the river and hung over the railing, and after that she
visited the orchard,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
 and every other forbidden place in the grounds. In
the orchard she found some half-ripe fruit under the trees, and gathered
it; and finding that she could not climb into the conservatory again
with the fruit in her hands, she amused herself by throwing it through
the open window.</p>

<p>It was harder to climb up than it had been to get down, but she
accomplished the feat at last with sundry abrasions, shut the window,
replaced the flower pots, got into the first and second, and went back
to bed. Her night-dress was wet with dew, and her feet were scratched
and dirty; but she was too much exhilarated by the exercise and
adventure to feel any discomfort. She was sitting up in bed, hungrily
munching some of her spoils, when Janey North, the girl in the next bed,
awoke.</p>

<p>"What are you eating, Beth?" she asked in a cautious voice, whispering,
fearful of awaking a monitress and being reported for talking.</p>

<p>"Apples," Beth answered. "Have some?"</p>

<p>"All right! but where did you get them?" Janey asked.</p>

<p>"Never you mind!" said Beth.</p>

<p>Janey did not mind at the moment, and ate the greater number, but next
day she went treacherously and told, in order to ingratiate herself with
one of the mistresses, and the matter was reported to Miss Clifford, who
sent for Beth. Janey North was also sent for.</p>

<p>"What is this I hear about your having apples in your bedroom last
night, Beth?" Miss Clifford said.</p>

<p>"A story, I should think," Beth answered readily. "Who told you?"</p>

<p>Janey North looked disconcerted.</p>

<p>"What have you to say, Miss North?" Miss Clifford asked.</p>

<p>"You <i>were</i> eating apples," Janey said to Beth.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Beth asked suavely.</p>

<p>"I saw you."</p>

<p>"What, in the middle of the night when the gas was out?"</p>

<p>"Ye-yes," Janey faltered.</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders and looked at Miss Clifford, who said
severely: "I think, Miss North, you have either dreamt this story or
invented it."</p>

<p>Janey was barred in the school after that, the girls deciding that,
whether the story were true or not, she was a dockyard girl for telling
it. It was Beth's sporting instinct that had made her evade the
question. When she had won the game, and the excitement was over, she
felt she had been guilty of duplicity, and determined to confess when
Miss Clifford sent for her next and gave her a good opportunity. She
would have gone at once but for the dread of losing the precious liberty
that was life to her. All

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
 through the weeks that followed she kept
herself sane and healthy by midnight exercises in the moonlight. Her
appetite had failed her till she took to this diversion, but after her
second ramble she was so hungry that she went down to the kitchen boldly
to forage in the hope of finding a crust. The fire was still burning
brightly, and by its light she discovered on the table the thick bread
and butter for the next morning's breakfast, all cut ready, and piled up
under covers on the dishes. There was half a jug of beer besides,
doubtless left from the servants' supper. It was rather flat, but she
thought it and the new bread and butter delicious. She had a bad cold
after the first ramble, but that was the only one, strange to relate,
for she always went out in her night-dress, and bare-footed.</p>

<p>During this time her imagination was exceedingly active and her health
improved, but her work was a greater trouble than ever. She had just
been put into the third, but Miss Clifford threatened to put her down
again if she did not do better, and one day she sent for Beth, who went
trembling, under the impression that that was what the summons was for.
She found Miss Clifford and Miss Bey discussing a letter, and both
looking very serious.</p>

<p>"Beth," Miss Clifford began, "a gentleman whom I know well has written
to tell me that he was walking home by the river-path at two o'clock on
Monday morning, and saw a girl here at St. Catherine's with only her
night-dress on, hanging over the railing looking into the river; and I
am sure from the description it was you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Beth, "I saw him."</p>

<p>Miss Clifford let the letter fall on her lap, and Miss Bey dropped into
a chair. Beth looked on with interest, and wondered about that accurate
description of herself; she would have given anything to see it.</p>

<p>"What were you doing there?" Miss Clifford asked; and Beth noticed that
she was treating the matter just as her mother had treated the menagerie
business.</p>

<p>"Just looking at the water," Beth said.</p>

<p>"At two o'clock in the morning! How did you get out?"</p>

<p>"By the conservatory window."</p>

<p>"Had you been out before?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, often."</p>

<p>"Do any of the other girls go out?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," said Beth, then added, "No, I'm sure they don't."</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven for that, at all events!" Miss Clifford ejaculated. Then
she made Beth sit down beside her, and took her hand, and gazed at her
long and sorrowfully.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was it such a very dreadful thing to do?" Beth asked at last.</p>

<p>"You have been a great disappointment to me, Beth," Miss Clifford
answered indirectly, "and to Miss Bey. We expected more of you than of
any other girl now in the school&mdash;you promised so well in many ways at
one time."</p>

<p>"<i>Did I?</i>" said Beth, looking from one to the other in consternation.
"Oh, why didn't you tell me? I thought you all fancied I should never do
anything well, and that disheartened me. If I had known&mdash;&mdash;" She burst
into tears.</p>

<p>Late that night Miss Clifford and Miss Bey sat together discussing Beth.</p>

<p>"I feel more than ever convinced there is something exceptional about
the child," Miss Clifford declared. "I hope it is not insanity; but, at
all events, it is not sin, and I won't have her punished. I say now what
I said at first, she should have been sent here early, or not at all.
And now she must go."</p>

<p>"What, expel her!" Miss Bey ejaculated.</p>

<p>"No. Didn't I say I would not have her punished? There is some
explanation of her wild escapade besides mere naughtiness, I feel sure,
and she shall have every chance that I can give her. There is no vice in
her of any kind that I can discover, and she is fearlessly honest. If
she were grown-up we should call her eccentric, and be interested and
amused by her vagaries; and I do not see why she should not be allowed
the same excuse as it is, only St. Catherine's is not the place for her.
Here all must move in the common orbit, to save confusion. So I shall
write to her mother, and get her to take her from the school at the end
of the term in the regular way."</p>

<p>"But in the meantime?" Miss Bey asked.</p>

<p>"Beth has given me her word that she will be good, and do nothing I
should disapprove of, and she will keep it."</p>

<p>So Beth's credit was saved by the good judgment of this kind, wise
woman, and her career at St Catherine's ended honourably, if somewhat
abruptly.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> it was rumoured amongst the mistresses
that Beth was to leave that
term, Old Tom put her on to play first piano in the first-class solo,
and to lead the treble in the second-class duet at the examination.</p>

<p>"For I rather like ye, Miss Beth Caldwell," she said. "You're not a
sycophant, whatever else ye are. They've not been able to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> do much wi'
ye in regard to yer work in the rest of the school, but ye've done well
under me, and I'll let ye have yer chance to distinguish yerself before
ye go."</p>

<p>"Oh, but do you think I can do it?" Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Ye can do anything ye set yerself to do, Beth Caldwell," Old Tom
shouted at her.</p>

<p>Beth set herself accordingly, and when the day came she led the solo and
duet with the precision of a musical box, but with such an expenditure
of nerve-power that she was prostrated by the effort. She was considered
quite a musician at St. Catherine's, but by this time the dire method of
teaching had had its effect. Her confidence and her memory for music
were gone, the beauty of her touch spoilt, and the further development
of her talent effectually checked.</p>

<p>She did not go home for the holidays. Miss Clifford had advised, Lady
Benyon approved, and Mrs. Caldwell decided, that she should be sent
direct to a finishing school in London, and when St. Catherine's broke
up, Miss Bey, who happened to be going that way, good-naturedly
undertook to see Beth safely to her destination.</p>

<p>Miss Clifford held Beth's hand long, and gazed into her face earnestly
when she took leave of her. "I shall hear of you again," she said, "and
I pray God it may be good news; but it depends upon yourself, Beth. We
are free agents. Good-bye, my dear child, and God bless you."</p>

<p>Beth had been eighteen intolerable months at the school, and had been
exceedingly miserable most of the time, yet she left it with tears in
her eyes, melted and surprised by the kindest farewells from every one.
It had never dawned upon her until that moment that she was really very
much liked.</p>

<p>Her new school was a large house in a long wide street of houses, all
exactly alike. When she arrived with Miss Bey, they were shown into a
deliciously cool shady drawing-room, charmingly furnished, and the
effect upon Beth, after the graceless bareness of St. Catherine's, was
altogether reassuring.</p>

<p>In front of the fireplace, which was hidden by ferns and flowering
plants, a slender girl, with thick dark hair down her back, was lying on
the white woolly hearthrug, reading. She got up to greet the visitors
without embarrassment, still holding her book in her hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Blackburne will be here directly," she said. "Will you sit down?"
Then there was a little pause, which Miss Bey broke by asking in her
magisterial way, "What is that you are reading, my dear?"</p>

<p>"The Idylls of the King," the girl answered.</p>

<p>Miss Bey's nostrils flapped.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it not rather advanced for you, my dear?" she said. "We do not allow
it at all, even to our first-class girls."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Blackburne likes us to read it," was the easy answer. "She
says that Tennyson and all the good modern writers are a part of our
education."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" Beth ejaculated fervently. "At St. Catherine's our
minds were starved on books suited to the capacity of infants and
imbeciles."</p>

<p>"I should think, Beth, you are hardly old enough or educated enough to
be a judge of literature as yet," Miss Bey said severely.</p>

<p>"Nor do I pretend to be a judge. How can I know anything of literature
when literature is unknown at St. Catherine's? But I should think babes
and sucklings would be wise enough to object to the silly trash we had
instead of literature."</p>

<p>Beth spoke emphatically, shaking herself free of the restrictions of the
Royal Service School for Officers' Daughters once for all.</p>

<p>Miss Blackburne came in while she was speaking, and smiled.</p>

<p>"I like to hear a girl express an opinion," she said. "She may be quite
wrong, but she must have some mind if she attempts to think for herself
at all; and mind is material to work upon."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid <i>I</i> haven't much mind," Beth said, sighing, "or manner
either."</p>

<p>Miss Blackburne smiled again, and looked at Miss Bey; but Miss Bey
supported Beth in her self-depreciation by preserving an ominous
silence.</p>

<p>"This is one of your new school-fellows," Miss Blackburne said to Beth;
"let me introduce you to each other. Clara Herring, Beth Caldwell."</p>

<p>When Miss Bey took her leave, Miss Blackburne left the room with her,
and immediately afterwards another girl came in, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" she exclaimed, "Signor Caponi <i>is</i> a dear! He has the
nicest chocolate eyes, and he says my Italian is wonderful! Now I've
done all my work for to-day."</p>

<p>"Have you?" said Beth. "Why, it isn't five o'clock yet!"</p>

<p>"Miss Blackburne won't let us work long hours," the girl rejoined. "She
says it destroys our freshness. But let us know each other's names. I am
Geraldine Tressillion. Good name for a novel, isn't it?" and she clapped
her little white hands and laughed again.</p>

<p>"That's just what you're made to be&mdash;the heroine of a novel," Clara
Herring observed, looking at her admiringly. "I always think of you when
I come across a gay one, with golden hair and blue eyes."</p>

<p>"I have my good points, I know," Geraldine rejoined. "But how about my
hips? Too high, alas!"

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, that won't show much while you're slight," said Clara, looking at
her critically.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll make haste and marry me before I'm afflicted with flesh, as
I'm sure to become. For I deny myself nothing&mdash;I live to eat," Geraldine
rattled on cheerfully. "One can't get very fat before one comes out; and
I hate a thin dowager. I'm engaged already, you know, but I don't like
the man much&mdash;don't like him at all, in fact; and my sister says I can
do better. She's been married a year, and has a baby. She told me all
about it. Mamma imagines we're all innocent. A lady implored her to tell
my sister things before she married, but she said she really could not
speak to an innocent girl on such a subject. I don't believe she was
ever so innocent herself. A grown girl can't be innocent unless she's a
fool; but anyway, it's the right pose to pretend. You've got to play the
silly fool to please a man; then he feels superior."</p>

<p>"But it's hypocritical," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear. But you must be hypocritical if you want to be a man's
ideal of a woman. You must know nothing, do nothing, see nothing, but
just what suits his pleasure and convenience; and in order to answer to
his requirements you must be either a hypocrite, or a blind worm without
eyes or intelligence. Men don't like innocence because it's holy, but
because it whets their appetites, my sister says, and if they're
deceived it serves them right. They work the world for their own
pleasure, not ours; and we must look out for ourselves. If we want
money, liberty, devotion, admiration, and any other luxury, we must
pretend. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Beth rejoined. "But, personally, I shall never pretend
anything."</p>

<p>"Then you will suffer for your sincerity," Geraldine rejoined.</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders. The turn the conversation had taken was
distasteful to her, and she would not pursue it.</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Clara observed sententiously:</p>

<p>"Innocence is not impossible, Geraldine. Surely Adelaide is innocent
enough."</p>

<p>"I said innocence and intelligence were incompatible," Geraldine
answered. "You don't call Adelaide intelligent, do you?"</p>

<p>"Who is Adelaide?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"The daughter of a Roman Catholic peer," Geraldine replied. "She is
eighteen, and her mind is absolutely undeveloped. We think she's in
training for a convent, and that's why they don't let her learn much.
Miss Ella Blackburne is a Roman Catholic, and so also is Adelaide's
maid; They trot her round to all the observances of her Church
regularly, and in the intervals she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
 plays with the kitten. I don't know
why she should have been sent here at all, for this is a regular
forcing-house for the marriage market. Miss Blackburne expects all her
girls to marry well, and they generally do. I should think, Miss Beth,
she will be able to make something of you with those eyes!"</p>

<p>"Look at its neck and shoulders, too, and the way its head is set on
them!" Clara exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not to mention its hands and its complexion!" Geraldine supplemented.
"But its voice alone&mdash;<i>soft, gentle, and low</i>&mdash;would get it into the
peerage!"</p>

<p>Beth, unused to be appraised in this way, blushed and smiled, rather
pleased, but confused.</p>

<p>"How many girls are there here?" she asked, to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Six boarders till you came, but now we are seven," Clara answered.
"There are some day-girls too, but they are children, and don't count.
The greatest pickle in the school is the daughter of an Archbishop&mdash;at
least, she has been the greatest pickle so far&mdash;we don't know you as
yet, however. But we have heard things!"</p>

<p>"Come and see my room," Geraldine interrupted. "And perhaps you'd like
to see your own. It's next to mine."</p>

<p>"Are you allowed to go up and down stairs just as you like?" Beth asked
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" Geraldine cried. "You can go where you like and sit
where you like when you've done your work. We're not in prison!"</p>

<p>Beth had a dainty little room, hung with white curtains, all to herself.
Her heart expanded when she saw it. The delightful appearance of her new
surroundings had already begun to have the happiest effect upon her
mind.</p>

<p>When Geraldine took her into her own room she drew a yellow book from
under a quantity of linen in a drawer. "It's a French novel," she said.
"Miss Blackburne wouldn't let me read it for worlds if she knew, so you
mustn't tell. I'll lend it to you if you like."</p>

<p>"I couldn't read it if I would; I don't know enough," Beth said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll soon learn; and I'll tell you all there is in it. I say,
what size is your waist? Mine is only seventeen inches; but I laced till
I got shingles to reduce it to that. I know a doctor who says small
waists are neither healthy nor beautiful; but then they're the fashion,
and men are such awful fools about fashion. They sneer at a healthy
figure, and saddle themselves every day with ailing wives, all deformed,
because they're accustomed to see women so; and then they call <i>us</i>
silly! My husband won't think

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> <i>me</i>
 silly once I get command of his
money, whatever else he may think me. Till then&mdash;!" she made a pretty
gesture with her hands and laughed&mdash;Beth observing her the while with
deep attention as a new specimen.</p>

<p>She found eventually that Geraldine was not at all a bad girl, or in the
least inclined to be vicious, her conversation notwithstanding; she was
merely a shrewd one learning how to protect herself in that state of
life to which she was destined. If a woman is to make her way in society
and keep straight, she must have wits and knowledge of a special kind.
There is probably no more delightful, high-minded, charming-mannered,
honourable and trustworthy woman in the world than a well-bred
Englishwoman; but, on the other hand, there can be nothing more
vulgar-minded, coarse, and despicable than women of fashion tend to
become. There is no meanness nor shabbiness, not to mention fraud, that
they will not stoop to when it suits themselves, from tricking a
tradesman and sweating a servant, to neglecting their children,
deceiving their husbands, and slandering their friends. They are sheep
running hither and thither in servile imitation of each other, without
an original thought amongst them; the froth of society, with the natural
tendency of froth to rise to the surface and thence be swept aside; mere
bubbles, that shine a moment and then burst. It is fashion that unsexes
women and unmakes men. To be in the world of fashion and of it, is to
degenerate; but to be in it and not of it, to know it and remain
untainted, despising all it has to give, makes towards solid advance.
There are some ugly stages to be gone through, however, before the
advancement is pronounced.</p>

<p>The six girls at Miss Blackburne's were all daughters of people of
position, all enjoying the same advantages and under the same
influences; but three of them were already shaping themselves into women
of fashion, while the other three were tending as inevitably to develop
into women of fine character and cultivated mind. Beth was attracted to
all such women, and recognised their worth, often long before they
appreciated her at all. She was seventh among the girls, her place being
in the middle, as it were, with three on either side of her, teaching
her all they could, as was inevitable. In association with the budding
women of fashion, she lost the first fine delicacy of maiden modesty of
mind; but the example of the young gentlewomen, on the other hand,
confirmed her taste and settled her convictions. The ladies who kept the
school were high-minded themselves and exemplary in every possible way,
and if they did not make all their pupils equally so, it was because
factors go to the formation of character with which, for want of
knowledge, no one can reckon at present. The influence of these ladies
upon Beth was altogether benign.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
 She was in a new world with them&mdash;a
world of ease and refinement, of polished manners, of kindly
consideration, where, instead of being harried by nagging rules,
stultified by every kind of restraint, and lowered in her own estimation
for want of proper respect and encouragement, she was allowed as much
liberty as she would have had in a well-ordered home, and found herself
and her abilities of special interest to each of her teachers. Instead
of being an item, a part of a huge piece of machinery to be strictly
kept in the particular place assigned to her, whether it were adapted to
the needs of her nature or not, for fear of putting the whole mechanism
out of order, her present and future being less considered than the
smooth working of the machine&mdash;she was a girl again with some character
of her own to be formed and developed. Here, too, she was put upon her
honour to do all that was expected of her, and the immediate consequence
of this in her case was the most scrupulous exactness. She attached
herself to Miss Ella, attracted first of all by the fact that she was a
Roman Catholic. How she could be one was a mystery Beth longed to solve;
but Miss Ella did not consider it loyal to Protestant parents to
influence their daughters at school, and would give her no help in this.
In every other respect, however, Beth found her exceedingly kind and
sympathetic, a serene, strong woman, who began to curb the exuberance of
Beth's naughtiness from the first, and to direct the energy of which it
was the outcome into profitable channels.</p>

<p>There was no monotony in Miss Blackburne's establishment. The girls were
taken in turns to operas, concerts, picture-galleries, and every kind of
exhibition that might help to cultivate their minds. To be able to
discuss such things was a part of their education. They were expected to
describe all they saw, fluently and pleasantly, but without criticism
enough to require thought and provoke argument, which is apt to be
tedious; and thus was formed the habit of chatting in the genial light
frothy way which does duty for conversation in society. Geraldine had
not exaggerated when she called Miss Blackburne's school a forcing house
for the marriage market. At that time marriage was the only career open
to a gentlewoman, and the object of her education was to make her
attractive. The theory then was that solid acquirements were beyond the
physical strength of girls, besides being unnecessary. Showy
accomplishments, therefore, were all that was aimed at; but they had to
be thorough. Music, singing, drawing, dancing, French, German,
Italian&mdash;whatever it might be; the girl who was learning it had the
greatest attention from her master or mistress during the lesson; she
was made to do it as much by the will of the teacher as by her own
intelligence. This was the first experience of thorough teaching Beth
had ever

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
 had, and she enjoyed it, and would have worked harder to
profit by it than Miss Blackburne would allow. As it was, she made great
progress with her work, while all the time the more informal but most
valuable part of her education, which was directed to the strengthening
of every womanly attribute, went on steadily under the influence of Miss
Ella.</p>

<p>It would have been well for Beth if she had been left at Miss
Blackburne's for the next three years; but just when the rebellious
beating of her wings against the bars had ceased, and they had folded
themselves contentedly behind her for awhile; just when the wild flights
of her imagination were giving way to wholesome habits of thought, and
her own vain dreams were being dissipated by the honest ambition to
accomplish something actual&mdash;she was summoned away. Her sister Mildred
had died suddenly of meningitis, and the immediate effect of the shock
on Mrs. Caldwell, who had dearly loved her eldest daughter, was a
kindlier feeling for Beth, and a wish to have her at home&mdash;for a time at
all events. And Beth went willingly under the circumstances. She
sympathised deeply with her mother, and was full of grief herself for
her sister, to whom she had been tenderly attached although they had
seen so little of each other. Beth was not yet sixteen, and this was the
third blow that death had dealt her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> had a natural love of order, and at school she had learnt the
necessity for it. She did not mean to give up work when she went home;
on the contrary, she determined to do more than ever. Miss Ella had
taught her to be deliberate, neither to haste nor to rest, but steadily
to pursue. She insisted that things to be well done must be done
regularly, and Beth, in accordance with this precept, mapped out her day
so as to make the most of it. She got up at seven, opened her window
wider, threw the clothes back from her bed to air it, had her bath,
brushed her hair; left nothing untidy lying about her room; did her good
reading, the psalms and lessons; breakfasted, made her bed, studied
French, went out for exercise, sewed, and read so much, all in the same
order every day. She paid particular attention to her personal
appearance, too, that being the one of her mother's principles which had
also been most particularly enjoined by Miss Blackburne. At both of her
schools marriage was the great ambition of most of the girls. At St
Catherine's it meant a means of escape from many hardships; to Miss
Blackburne's girls it offered the chance of a better position, and more
money

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
 and luxury. There was a nicer tone among the Royal Service girls,
and more reticence in their discussions of the subject than at Miss
Blackburne's, where the girls were not at all high-minded, and talked of
their chances with the utmost frankness, not to say coarseness; but good
looks were held to be the best, if not the only means to the end in both
sets. Money and accomplishments might help, but personal appearance was
the great certainty; and Beth was naturally impressed with this idea
like the rest. Marriage, however, was far from being the distinct object
of her life; in fact, she had no distinct object at all as yet. She had
always meant to do something, or rather to be something; but further
than that she had not got.</p>

<p>Miss Blackburne had paid particular attention to the cultivation of the
speaking voice, and it was from her that Beth had learnt how to round
hers to richness, and modulate it so that its natural sweetness and
charm were greatly enhanced. There was considerable difference of
opinion about her looks. She was always striking in appearance, but
dress, for one thing, altered her very much, and the state of her mind
still more. People who met her on one occasion admired her exceedingly,
and on the next wondered why they had thought her good-looking at all.
She had the mesmeric quality which makes it impossible to escape
observation, and her personality never failed to interest the
intelligent whether it pleased them or not; but she was only at her best
in mind, manner, and appearance when her fitful further faculty was
active; then indeed she shone with a strange loveliness, a light to be
felt rather than seen, and not to be described at all. At such times the
mere physical beauty of other women went out in her immediate
neighbourhood, and was no more thought of. It was not until she was
quite mature, however, that her manner permanently acquired that subtle
indefinable quality called charm, which is the outcome of a large
tolerant nature and kindness of heart. It was as if she did not come
into full possession of her true self until she had experienced
numberless other phases of being common to the race. Hence the
apparently incongruous mixture she presented in the earlier stages of
her youth, her sluggish indifference at times, her excesses of energy
and zeal, her variations of taste.</p>

<p>At first, after she left school, as was inevitable, her self-discipline
was irksome enough at times, and some of the details she shirked; but
not for long, because the time which accustomed duties should have
occupied hung heavy on her hands, and she felt dissatisfied with herself
rather than relieved when she neglected them. So by degrees her habits
were formed, and in after life she found them a very present help in
time of trouble,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
 anchors which kept her from drifting to leeward, as
she must have done but for their hold upon her. Some of her erratic
tricks were not to be cured, but they came to be part of the day's work
rather than a hindrance to it. She saw many a sunrise, for instance, and
revelled with uplifted spirit in the beauty and wonder of the hour; but
the soul that sang responsive to the glories of the summer dawn, the
colour, the freshness, the perfume, was steeped at noon with equal
energy in the book she was studying, so that, instead of losing
anything, she gained that day one sunrise more.</p>

<p>When she left school Beth was fastidiously refined. She hurried over all
the hateful words and passages in the Bible, Shakespeare, or any other
book she might be reading. The words she would not even pronounce to
herself, so strongly did her delicate mind revolt from a vile idea, and
sicken at the expression of it. But, nevertheless, she pored patiently
over every book she could get that had a great reputation, and in this
way she read many not usually given to girls, and became familiarised
with certain facts of life not generally supposed to be of soul-making
material. But she took no harm. The soul that is shaping itself to noble
purpose, the growing soul, tries more than is proper for its nourishment
in its search for sustenance, but rejects all that is unnecessary or
injurious, as water creatures without intelligence reject any unsuitable
substance they collect with their food.</p>

<p>Before she had been many days at home, Beth found that her mother had
made a new acquaintance, who came to the house often in a casual way
like an intimate friend. He came in on the day of her arrival after
dinner, and was introduced to Beth by her mother as "the doctor." Beth
broke into smiles, for she recognised her long-ago acquaintance of the
rocks, the doctor of her Hector-romance. And it seemed he really was a
doctor; now that was a singular coincidence! In their little
drawing-room she discovered him to be a bigger man than she had
supposed, but otherwise he was like her first impression of him,
striking because of his colouring; the red and white of his complexion,
which was unusually clear for a man, and the lightness of his grey-green
eyes being in peculiar contrast to the blackness of his hair. She
noticed again, too, that the expression of his face when he smiled was
not altogether agreeable, because his teeth were too far apart; and she
also thought his finely-formed hands would have looked better had they
not been so obtrusively white.</p>

<p>"But we have met before," he exclaimed when Beth acknowledged the
introduction. "You are the young lady I helped on the rocks one day,
quite a long time ago now, when you were a little girl."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember," Beth said, noticing that he claimed to have helped her on
that occasion, and remembering also that she had declined his help.</p>

<p>"You never told me, Beth," her mother said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"There was really nothing to tell," he answered, coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>"What a day that was!" Beth observed. "Did you notice the sea? It was
the sort of sea that might make one long to be a crab to live in it.
Though a crab is not the animal that I should specially choose to be. I
long to be a cat sometimes. To be able to fluff out my fur and spit
would be such a satisfaction. There are feelings that can be expressed
in no other way. And then to be able to purr! Purring is the one sound
in nature that expresses perfect comfort and content, I think."</p>

<p>"Beth, don't talk nonsense," her mother said impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not nonsense altogether," the doctor interposed. "It is just
cheery chatter, and that is good. Miss Beth will raise your spirits in
no time, or I'm much mistaken." He had watched Beth with gravity while
she was speaking, as one sees people watch an actress critically,
obviously marking her points, but betraying no emotion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell sighed heavily. "The doctor has been so good, Beth," she
said. "He has come here continually, and done more to cheer me than
anybody."</p>

<p>"Oh now, Mrs. Caldwell, you exaggerate," he remonstrated with a smile.
"But it's my principle, you know, to be cheery. I always say be cheery
whatever happens. It's no use crying over spilt milk!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A merry heart goes all the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Your sad tires in a mile-a,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beth rattled off glibly, and again the doctor considered her.</p>

<p>"Now that's good," he said, just as if he had never heard it before;
"and it's my meaning exactly. Don't let your spirits go down&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For there's many a girl, as I know well,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A-looking for you in the town,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beth concluded, her spirits rising uproariously.</p>

<p>"Beth!" her mother remonstrated, but with a smile.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is, the ones on the look-out are not the ones with the
good looks," the doctor observed, also smiling.</p>

<p>"But they are the ones with the money," Beth rejoined. "I wonder how it
is that plain girls so often have money. I suppose the money-grubbing
spirit comes out in ugliness in the female branch."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Tea was brought in, but Beth refused to take any. The doctor tried to
persuade her.</p>

<p>"You had better change your mind," he said. "Ladies are privileged to
change their minds."</p>

<p>"I know," said Beth. "Ladies are privileged to be foolish. It is almost
the only privilege men allow them. I scorn it myself. At school we were
warned to be firm when once we had said 'No, thank you.' Miss Ella used
to say that people who allowed themselves to be over-persuaded and
changed their minds lost self-control and became self-indulgent
eventually."</p>

<p>"Ah, that makes me think of my poor dear mother," said the doctor. "A
better and more consistent woman never lived. Once she said a thing, you
couldn't move her. She was a good mother to me! I was always her
favourite son. But, like other young fellows, I'm afraid I didn't half
appreciate her till I had lost her."</p>

<p>"All the same, I am sure you were all that a good son should be," Mrs.
Caldwell observed sincerely.</p>

<p>The doctor's eyes shone with emotion.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Mrs. Caldwell began to discuss him.</p>

<p>"He really <i>is</i> cheery," she said, "he always raises my spirits; and I
am sure he is good and kind. Did you see how his eyes filled with tears
when he mentioned his mother? He is handsome, too, don't you think so?
Such a colour! And always so well dressed. Lady Benyon admires him very
much. But he gets on with every one, even Uncle James! What do you think
of him, Beth?"</p>

<p>"I think he looks neat to the point of nattiness, which is finical in a
man," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is because you are not accustomed to well-dressed men," her
mother assured her. "Here in Rainharbour you don't often see one."</p>

<p>"I have been in London lately," Beth observed.</p>

<p>"Beth," her mother began emphatically, "that is so like you! Will you
never get out of the habit of answering so? You are always in
opposition, and it is too conceited of you at your age. I did hope they
would have cured you of the trick at school; but no sooner do you get
home, than you begin again as bad as ever."</p>

<p>"Well, rather than displease you, mamma, I'll do my best to hold my
tongue for the future when I can't say what you want me to say," Beth
answered cheerfully. "I came home to be a comfort to you, and if I can't
be a comfort to you and express myself as well, why, I must go
unexpressed."</p>

<p>"Now, there you are again, Beth," Mrs. Caldwell cried peevishly. "Is
that a nice thing to say?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth looked at her mother and smiled enigmatically. Then she reflected.
Then her countenance cleared.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said, "your hair is much whiter than it was; but I don't
think I ever saw you look so nice. You have such a pretty complexion,
and so few wrinkles, and such even teeth! What a handsome girl you must
have been!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell smiled complacently, and went to bed in high good humour.
She told Bernadine, as they undressed, that she thought Beth greatly
improved.</p>

<p>But Beth herself lay long awake that night; tossing and troubled,
feeling far from satisfied either with herself or anybody else.</p>

<p>The next morning she rose early and drew up her plan of life.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> that first day at home wore on, Beth was
seized with an importunate
yearning to go out, and it was with difficulty that she got through her
self-appointed tasks. She thought of the sea, the shore, the silence and
solitude, which were apt to be so soothing to her dull senses that she
ceased to perceive with them, and so passed into the possession of her
farther faculty for blissful moments. She fancied the sea was as she
best loved to have it, her favourite sea, with tiny wavelets bringing
the tide in imperceptibly over the rocks, and the long stretch of water
beyond heaving gently up to the horizon, with smooth unruffled surface
shining in the sun. When she had done her work she fared forth to the
sea, to sit by it, and feel the healthy happy freshness of it all about
her, and in herself as well. She went to the rocks. The tide was coming
in. The water, however, was not molten silver-grey, as she had imagined
it, but bright dark sapphire blue, with crisp white crests to the waves,
which were merry and tumbled. It was the sea for an active, not for a
meditative mood; its voice called to play, rather than to that prayer of
the whole being which comes of the contemplation of its calmness; it
exhilarated instead of soothing, and made her joyous as she had not been
since she went to school. She stood long on the rocks by the water's
edge, retreating as the tide advanced, watching wave after wave curve
and hollow itself and break, and curve and hollow itself and break
again. The sweet sea-breeze sang in her ears, and braced her with its
freshness, while the continuous sound of wind and water went from her
consciousness and came again with the ebb and flow of her thoughts. But
the strength and swirl of the water, its tireless force, its incessant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
voices choiring on a chorus of numberless notes, invited her, fascinated
her, filled her with longing&mdash;longing to trust herself to the waves, to
lie still and let them rock her, to be borne out by them a little way
and brought back again, passive yet in ecstatic enjoyment of the dreamy
motion. The longing became an impulse. She put her hand to her throat to
undo her dress&mdash;but she did not undo it&mdash;she never knew why. Had she
yielded to the attraction, she must have been drowned, for she could
swim but little, and the water was deeper than she knew, and the current
strong; and she might have yielded just as she resisted, for no reason
that rendered itself into intelligible thought.</p>

<p>She turned from the scene of her strange impulse, and began to wander
back over the rocks, suffering the while from that dull drop of the
spirit which sets in at the reaction after moments of special intensity;
and in this mood she came upon "the doctor," also climbing the rocks.</p>

<p>"Now, it is a singular coincidence that I should meet you here again,"
he said.</p>

<p>Beth smiled. "I am afraid those nice boots of yours will suffer on these
sharp rocks," she remarked by way of saying something. "We natives keep
our old ones for the purpose."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "I don't keep old ones for any purpose. I have an
objection to everything old, old people included."</p>

<p>Beth had a book under her arm, and he coolly took it from her as he
spoke, and read the title: "Dryden's Poetical Works." "Ah! So you carry
the means of improving your mind at odd moments about with you. Well,
I'm not surprised, for I heard you were clever."</p>

<p>Beth smiled, more pleased than if he had called her beautiful; but she
wondered if Dryden could properly be called improving.</p>

<p>"It is absurd to keep a girl at school who has got as far as this kind
of thing," he added, tapping the old brown book; "but it seems to me
they don't understand you much at home, little lady."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" Beth asked shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, somewhat disconcerted, "I judge from&mdash;from things I
hear and see."</p>

<p>This implied sympathy, and again Beth was pleased.</p>

<p>It was late when she got in, and she expected her mother to be annoyed;
but Mrs. Caldwell was all smiles.</p>

<p>"I suppose the doctor found you?" she said. "He asked where you were,
and I said on the rocks probably."</p>

<p>"That accounts for the singular coincidence," Beth observed; but,
girl-like, she thought less at the moment of the little insincerity than
of the compliment his following her implied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>They dined that evening with Lady Benyon. It was a quiet little family
party, including Uncle James and Aunt Grace Mary. The doctor was the
only stranger present. He looked very well in evening dress.</p>

<p>"Striking, isn't he?" Aunt Grace Mary whispered to Beth. "Such
colouring!"</p>

<p>"And how are you, Dan?" was Uncle James's greeting, uttered with an
affectation of cordiality in his unexpected little voice that interested
Beth. She wondered what was toward. She noticed, too, that she herself
was an object of special attention, and her heart expanded with
gratification. Very little kindness went a long way with Beth.</p>

<p>Dr. Dan took her in to dinner.</p>

<p>"By the way," he said, looking across the table at Uncle James, "I went
to see that old Mrs. Prince, your keeper's mother, as I promised. She's
a wonderful old woman for eighty-five. I shouldn't be surprised if she
lived to a hundred."</p>

<p>"Dear! dear!" Uncle James ejaculated with something like consternation.</p>

<p>"I seem to have put my foot in it somehow," Dr. Dan remarked to Beth
confidentially.</p>

<p>"If you do anything to keep her alive you will," Beth answered. "Uncle
James always speaks bitterly about elderly women;&mdash;about old ones he is
perfectly rabid. He seems to think they rob worthy men of part of their
time by living so long."</p>

<p>It was arranged before the party broke up that the doctor should drive
Beth to Fairholm in the Benyon dogcart to lunch next day. Beth was
surprised and delighted to find herself the object of so much
consideration. Dr. Dan, as they all called him, began to be associated
in her mind with happy days.</p>

<p>"Have you come to live here?" she asked as they drove along.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "I am only putting in the time until I can settle
down to a practice of my own. I have just heard of one which I shall buy
if I can get an appointment I am trying for in the same place."</p>

<p>"What is the appointment?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"It's a hospital I want to be put in charge of," he answered
casually,&mdash;"a small affair, but I should get a regular income from it,
and that would make my rent, and all that sort of thing, secure. A
doctor has to set up with a show of affluence."</p>

<p>"It is a terrible profession to me, the medical profession," Beth said.
"The responsibilities must be so great and so various."</p>

<p>"Oh, I never think of that," he answered easily.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should," Beth rejoined.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>you</i> would, of course," he said; "and that shows what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> folly it
is for women to go in for medicine. They worry about this and that,
things that are the patient's look-out, not the doctor's, and make no
end of mischief; besides always losing their heads in a difficulty."</p>

<p>Just then the horse, which had been very fidgety all the way, bolted.
The blood rushed into the doctor's face. "Sit tight! sit tight!" he
exclaimed. "Don't now,&mdash;now don't move and make a fuss. Keep cool."</p>

<p>"Keep cool yourself," said Beth dryly. "<i>I</i>'m all right."</p>

<p>Dr. Dan glanced at her sideways, and saw that she was laughing.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Fairholm, he made much of the incident. "If I
hadn't had my wits about me, there would have been a smash," he vowed.
"But I happened to be on the spot myself, and Miss Beth behaved
admirably. Most girls would have shrieked, you know, but she behaved
heroically."</p>

<p>This was all rather gushing, but it did not offend Beth, because she
associated gush with Aunt Grace Mary, who had always been kind to her.
Gushing people are usually weak and amiable, gush being the ill-judged
outcome of a desire to please; but at that happy age it was the amiable
intention that Beth took into account. Her desire to be pleased, which
had so seldom been gratified, had become a danger to her judgment by
this time; it made her apt to respond to any attempt to please her
without considering means and motives which should have discounted her
appreciation. Everybody was trying to please her now, and all her being
answered only too readily. She spent a delightful day at Fairholm, and
went home in extravagantly high spirits.</p>

<p>Dr. Dan called early the next morning, and found her with her hat on,
just going out.</p>

<p>"How are you this misty cold grey day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, very bright," she answered. "I feel as if I were the sun, and I'm
just going to shine out on the world to enliven it."</p>

<p>"May I accompany you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The sun, alas! is a solitary luminary," she answered, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Then I shall hope for better luck next time," he said, and let her go
alone.</p>

<p>In the evening he came in again to have a game of cribbage with Mrs.
Caldwell. Beth was sleepy and had gone to bed early. In the pauses of
the game they talked about her, and the responsibilities of a family.</p>

<p>"A girl wants some one to look after her," the doctor said, "especially
if she has money."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," Mrs. Caldwell replied, "girls are a great anxiety. Now a
boy you can put into a profession and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
 done with it. But it is not
so easy to find a suitable husband for a girl."</p>

<p>"But, of course, if she has a little money it makes a difference," he
observed. "Only she should have some one to advise her in the spending
of it. Now, Miss Beth, for instance, will be as much a child at
twenty-one in money matters as she is now."</p>

<p>"I hope we shall find the right man for her before then," Mrs. Caldwell
answered archly; "not that I think her aunt's fortune will cause her
much anxiety." She alluded to the smallness of the sum.</p>

<p>"She gets some of the interest, I suppose, to go on with," he said.</p>

<p>"Just enough to dress on."</p>

<p>Beth saw a great deal of Dr. Dan after that. She was not in the least in
love with him, but they became intimate all the sooner on that account.
A girl shrinks more shyly from a man she loves than from one for whom
she has only a liking; in the one case every womanly instinct is on the
alert, in the other her feeling is not strong enough to seem worth
curbing. Beth was fond of men's companionship, and Dr. Dan's assiduous
attentions enlivened her, made her brain active, and brought the vision
and the dream within reach; so that she moved in a happy light, but
considered the source of it no more than she would have considered the
stick that held the candle by which she read an entrancing book.</p>

<p>There are idyllic gleams in all interesting lives; but life as we live
it from day to day is not idyllic. In Beth's case there was the
inevitable friction, the shocks and jars of difficulties and
disagreements with her mother. These had been suspended for a time after
her return, but began to break out again, fomented very often by
Bernadine, who was always her mother's favourite, but was never a
pleasant child. Dr. Dan came one very wet day, and found Beth sitting in
the drawing-room alone, looking miserable. She had done all her little
self-imposed tasks honestly, but had reaped no reward. On the contrary,
there had come upon her a dreadful vision of herself doing that sort of
thing on always into old age, as Aunt Victoria did her French, with no
object, and to no purpose; and for the first time she formulated a
feeling that had gradually been growing up in her of late: "I must have
more of a life than this." What could she do, however, tied to that
stupid place, without a suspicion as yet that she had it in her to do
anything special, and without friends to help her, with no one to
advise. As she reflected, the hopelessness of it all wrung from her some
of the bitterest tears she ever shed. If her mother would only send her
back to Miss Blackburne she would be learning something, at all events;
but, although Mrs. Caldwell had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
 said nothing definite on the subject,
Beth was pretty certain by this time that she did not mean to let her
return to school.</p>

<p>Beth was in the middle of this misery when Dr. Dan arrived.</p>

<p>"How's this?" he said, "Down? You should have the window open. It's not
cold to-day, though it's wet; and the room is quite stuffy. Never be
afraid of fresh air, you know."</p>

<p>"I'm not," Beth said. "I didn't know the window was shut. Open it as
wide as you like&mdash;the wider the better for me."</p>

<p>"That's better," he said, as the fresh air flowed in. "It's singular how
women will shut themselves up. No wonder they get out of spirits! Now, I
never let myself run down. When one thing goes wrong, I just take up
another, and don't bother. You'd think I wasn't having much of a time
here; but I'm as happy as the day is long, and I want to see you the
same." He sat down beside her on the old-fashioned sofa, took her hand,
and began to stroke it gently. "Cheer up, little girl," he added. "I
believe you've been crying. Aren't they kind to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they're kind enough," Beth answered, soothed by the caress; "at
least they mean to be. The misery is in myself. I feel all
dissatisfied."</p>

<p>"Not when I'm with you, do you?" he asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No, I don't bother about myself when I have you to talk to," Beth
answered. "You come in fresh, and give me something else to think
about."</p>

<p>"Then, look here, Beth," he said, putting his arm round her. "I don't
think I can do better than take you away with me. You've a head on your
shoulders, and an original way with you that would be sure to bring
people about the house, and you're well connected and look it;&mdash;all of
which would be good for my practice. Besides, a young doctor must marry.
I'm over thirty, though you might not think it. Come, what do you say?
You'd have a very good time of it as my wife, I can tell you. All your
own way, and no nagging. You know what <i>I</i> am, a cheery fellow, never
put out by anything. Now, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Are you asking me to marry you?" said Beth, breaking into a smile. The
position struck her as comical rather than serious.</p>

<p>"Why, what else?" he replied, smiling also. "I see you are recovering
your spirits. You'll be as happy as the day is long when we're married.
You'd never get on with anybody else as you'd do with me. I don't think
anybody else would understand you."</p>

<p>Beth laughed. She liked him, and she liked to be caressed. Why not marry
him and be independent of every one? She hadn't the slightest objection
at the moment; far from it, for she saw in the offer the one means of
escape she was likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
 to have from the long dull dreary days, and the
loneliness, which was all the life she could have to look forward to
when he had gone. And he was good-looking, too, and nice&mdash;everybody said
so. Besides, they would all be pleased if she accepted him, her mother
especially so. Now that she came to think of it, she perceived that this
was what they had been suggesting to her ever since her return.</p>

<p>"It is settled then?" he said, stooping forward to look into her face.</p>

<p>She looked at him shyly and laughed again. For the life of her she could
not keep her countenance, although she felt she was behaving in the
silly, giggling-girl sort of way she so much despised.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he exclaimed, looking extremely well pleased; and at
that moment Mrs. Caldwell walked into the room, just in time to witness
a lover-like caress. Beth jumped up, covered with confusion. Mrs.
Caldwell looked from one to the other, and waited for an explanation.</p>

<p>"We've just come to the conclusion that we cannot live apart," Dan said
deliberately, rising at the same time and taking Beth's hand.</p>

<p>"My dear child!" Mrs. Caldwell exclaimed, embracing Beth with happy
tears in her eyes. "This <i>is</i> a joy! I <i>do</i> congratulate you."</p>

<p>Beth became suddenly serious. The aspect of the affair had changed. It
was no longer a game of the moment, but a settled business, already
irrevocable. She wanted to explain that she had not actually pledged
herself, that she must take time to consider; but her heart failed her
in view of her mother's delight. It was Beth's great weakness that, as a
rule, she could neither spoil pleasure nor give pain to save herself in
an emergency.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Dan came to see her the next morning, he
found her in a mixed mood.
Half-a-dozen times during the night she had declined to marry him in a
painful scene, but just as often her imagination would run on into the
unknown life she would have to lead with him. She saw herself in white
satin and lace and pearls, a slender figure at the head of a long
dining-table, interesting to everybody, and Dan was at the foot, looking
quite distinguished in evening dress, with his glossy black hair and
wonderful clear skin. She had gathered the nicest people in the
neighbourhood about her, and on her right there was a shadowy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> person, a
man of mark, and knightly, who delighted in her conversation.</p>

<p>When she came downstairs to receive Dan she was coughing, and he showed
his devotion by being greatly concerned about her health. He said she
must have port wine and a tonic, and be out in the air as much as
possible, and suggested that they should go for a walk at once as it was
a lovely day, though still wet under foot.</p>

<p>"I would not ask you to walk if I had a carriage to offer you," he said,
"for I hate to see a delicate lady on foot in the mud. But you shall
have your carriage yet, please God, all in good time!"</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?" said Beth when they left the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, anywhere," he answered. "Take me to one of your own favourite
haunts."</p>

<p>She thought of the Fairholm cliffs for a moment, but felt that they were
sacred to many recollections with which she would not care to associate
this new experience. "I'll show you the chalybeate spring," she said.</p>

<p>They turned out of Orchard Street, and went down the hill to the Beck, a
broad, clear, shallow rivulet, that came round a sharp green curve
between high banks, well wooded with old trees, all in their heavy,
dark-green, summer foliage. As they crossed the rustic wooden bridge
Beth paused a little to look up at the trees and love them, and down
into the clear water at the scarlet sticklebacks heading up stream. Her
companion looked at her in surprise when she stopped, and then followed
the direction of her eyes. All he saw, however, was a shallow stream, a
green bank, and some trees.</p>

<p>"This is not very interesting," he observed.</p>

<p>Beth made no reply, but led the way up the hill on the other side, and,
to the right, passed a row of cottages with long gardens at the back
running down to the brow of the bank that overhung the Beck. In most of
these cottages she was an object of suspicion because of her uncanny
words and ways, and she knew it, and the thought of it was a grief to
her. She wanted the people to like her as she would have liked them had
they let her. The wish to win them fired her imagination. She looked on
ahead into futurity, and was a beautiful lady, driving a pair of ponies
down a wooded lane, with a carriage full of good things for the
cottagers, and they all loved her, and were very glad to see her.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"How nice it would be to be rich," she replied.</p>

<p>"But you will be well off when you're twenty-one, I am told."</p>

<p>"I suppose there's a chance of it," she answered dreamily.</p>

<p>(The ponies had arrived at the village by this time, and she was looking
up at an old grey church with a red roof.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know what your aunt's income was?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Seven or eight hundred a year," she answered absently.</p>

<p>(The sexton's little house stood by the gate leading into the
churchyard. His wife came out when the carriage stopped, wiping
soap-suds from her bare arms with her apron. Beth leaned forward and
held out her hand to her, and the woman smiled a cordial welcome. She
had a round flat face and fair hair. Then Beth handed her a mysterious
package from the carriage, which she received half in delight and half
in inquiry.)</p>

<p>But Beth's imagination stopped there, for she perceived that she had
passed the gate of the garden in which was the chalybeate spring. There
was a cottage in the garden, and Beth turned back, and went up to the
door, where a woman was standing holding a plump child, whose little fat
thigh, indented by the pressure, bulged over her bare arm.</p>

<p>"May we have a drink, please?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and welcome," the woman answered. "I'll fetch you a glass."</p>

<p>"Let me hold the baby," said Beth.</p>

<p>The woman smiled, and handed him to her. Beth took him awkwardly, and
squeezed him up in her arms as a child holds a kitten.</p>

<p>"Isn't he nice?" she said.</p>

<p>"That's a matter of taste," Dan answered. "I don't like 'em fat-bottomed
myself."</p>

<p>Beth froze at the expression. When the woman returned, she handed the
child back to her carefully, but without a smile, took the glass, and
went down to the spring by a narrow winding path which took them out of
sight of the cottage directly. Here it was old trees again, and green
banks, with the Beck below. When they were under the trees Beth looked
up at a big elm, and her companion noticed her lips move.</p>

<p>"What are you saying to yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing to myself," she answered. "I'm saying, 'Oh, tree, give me of
thy strength!' the Eastern invocation."</p>

<p>He laughed, and wanted to know what rot that was; and again Beth was
jarred.</p>

<p>"You'll have no luck if you don't respect the big trees," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, by Jove, if we wait for the big trees to make our luck, we shan't
have much!" he rejoined, picking up a pebble and firing it into the Beck
below.</p>

<p>They were on a narrow path now, about half-way down the bank, and here,
in a hollow, the chalybeate spring bubbled out, and was gathered by a
wooden spout into a slender stream, which fell on the ground, where, in
the course of time, it had made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
 basin for itself that was always
partly full. The water was icy cold, and somewhat the colour of light on
steel. Beth held the glass to the spout, rinsed it first, then filled
it, and offered it to Dan, but he dryly declined to take it "Not for me,
thank you," he said; "I never touch any medicinal beastliness."</p>

<p>For the third time Beth was jarred. She threw the water on the ground,
refilled the glass, and drank. Dan saw he had made a mistake.</p>

<p>"I'll change my mind and have some too," he said, anxious to mollify
her.</p>

<p>Beth filled the glass again, and handed it to him in silence, but no
after-thought could atone for the discourtesy of his first refusal, and
she looked in another direction, not even troubling herself to see
whether he tried the water or not.</p>

<p>There was a rustic seat in the hollow of the bank, and he suggested that
they should sit there a while before they returned. Beth acquiesced; and
soon the sputter of the little spring bubbling into its basin, the
chitter of birds in the branches above, the sunbeams filtering from
behind through the leaves, the glint of the Beck below slipping between
its banks, soundless, to the sea, enthralled her.</p>

<p>"Isn't this lovely?" she ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very jolly&mdash;with you," he said.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like it so well without me?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"No, I should think not," he rejoined. "And you wouldn't like it as well
without me, I hope."</p>

<p>"No," Beth responded. "It makes it nicer having some one to share it."</p>

<p>"Now that's not quite kind," he answered in an injured tone. "Some one
is any one; and <i>I</i> shouldn't be satisfied with anybody but you."</p>

<p>"Well, but I am satisfied with you," Beth answered dispassionately.</p>

<p>He took her hand, laid it in his own palm, and looked at it. It was a
child's hand as yet, delicately pink and white.</p>

<p>"What a pretty thing!" he said. "Oh, you smile at that." He reached up
to put a lock of her brown hair back from her cheek, and then he put his
arm round her.</p>

<p>Next day he was obliged to go away&mdash;Beth never thought of inquiring why
or wherefore; but she heard her mother and Lady Benyon talking about the
very eligible appointment he was hoping to get. He took an affectionate
leave of her. When he had gone she went off to the sands, and was
surprised to find how glad she was to be alone again. The tide was far
out, and there were miles and miles of the hard buff sand, a great, open
space, not empty to Beth, but teeming with thought and full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> of feeling.
Some distance on in front of her there was a solitary figure, a man
walking with bent head and hands folded behind him, holding a
stick&mdash;Count Gustav Bartahlinsky's favourite attitude when deep in
meditation. Beth hurried on, and soon overtook him.</p>

<p>"Would you rather be alone, Count Gustav?" she said.</p>

<p>He turned to look at her, then smiled, and they walked on together.</p>

<p>"So they are going to marry you off," he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Beth answered laconically.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to be married?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not."</p>

<p>"Then why do you consent?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm weak; I can't help it," she said.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I can't," she repeated. "I'm firm enough about some things, but in this
I vacillate. When I am alone I know I am making a mistake, but when I am
with other people who think differently, my objection vanishes."</p>

<p>"What is your objection?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is the difficulty," she said. "I can't define it. Do you know Dr.
Dan?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I know him," he answered. "I have met him and talked to
him. He expresses the most unexceptional opinions; but it is premature
to respect a man for the opinions he expresses&mdash;wait and see what he
does. Words and acts don't necessarily agree. Sometimes, however, a
chance remark which has very little significance for the person who
makes it, is like an aperture that lets in light on the whole
character." He cogitated a little, then added, "Don't let them hurry
you. Take time to know your man, and if you are not satisfied yourself,
if there is anything that jars upon <i>you</i>, never mind what other people
think, have nothing to do with him."</p>

<p>When Beth went home, she found her mother sitting by the drawing-room
window placidly knitting and looking out. "I am afraid I am very late,"
Beth said. "I have been on the sands with Count Gustav."</p>

<p>"Ah, that was nice, I should think," Mrs. Caldwell observed graciously.
"And what were you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Being married, principally," Beth answered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell beamed above her knitting. "And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He strongly advised me not to marry if I didn't want to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell changed countenance. "Did he indeed?" she observed with a
sniff. Then she reflected. "And what had you been saying to draw such a
remark from him?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>"I said I didn't want to be married," Beth blurted out with an effort.</p>

<p>"How could you tell Count Gustav such a story, Beth?" Mrs. Caldwell
asked, shaking her head reproachfully.</p>

<p>"It was no story, mamma."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Beth," her mother rejoined. "It is nothing but perverseness
that makes you say such things. You feel more interesting, I believe,
when you are in opposition. If I had refused to allow you to be married,
you would have been ready to run away. <i>I</i> know girls! They all want to
be married, and they all pretend they don't. Why, when I was a girl I
thought of nothing else; but I didn't talk about it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had nothing else to think about," Beth ventured.</p>

<p>"And what have you to think about, pray?"</p>

<p>Beth clasped her hands, and her grey eyes dilated.</p>

<p>"Beth, don't look like that," her mother remonstrated. "You are always
acting, and it <i>is</i> such a pity&mdash;as you will find when you go out into
the world, I am afraid, and people avoid you."</p>

<p>"I didn't know I was doing anything peculiar," Beth said; "and how am I
to help it if I don't know?"</p>

<p>"Just help it by only doing as you are told until you are able to judge
for yourself. Look at the silly way you have been talking this
afternoon! What must Count Gustav have thought of you? Never be so silly
again. You <i>must</i> be married now, you know. When a girl lets a man kiss
her, she <i>has</i> to marry him."</p>

<p>Beth had been watching her mother's fingers as she knitted until she was
half mesmerised by the bright glint of the needles; but now she woke up
and burst out laughing. "If that be the case," she said, "he is not the
only one that I shall have to marry."</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell's hands dropped on her lap, and she looked up at Beth in
dismay. "What do you mean?" she said.</p>

<p>"Just that," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me you have allowed men to kiss you?" Mrs. Caldwell
cried.</p>

<p>Beth looked up as if trying to keep her countenance.</p>

<p>"You wicked girl, how dare you?"</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, if it were wicked, why didn't you warn me?" Beth said.
"How was I to know?"</p>

<p>"Your womanly instincts ought to have taught you better."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for this theory, all Beth's womanly instincts set in the
opposite direction. Her father's ardent temperament warred in her with
Aunt Victoria's Puritan principles, and there was no telling as yet
which would prevail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth made no reply to that last assertion of her mother's, but remained
half sitting on the table, with her feet stretched out in front of her,
and her hands supporting her on either side, which brought her shoulders
up to her ears. It was a most inelegant attitude, and peculiarly
exasperating to Mrs. Caldwell.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wicked&mdash;you bad&mdash;you <i>abandoned</i> girl!" she exclaimed, losing
her temper altogether. "My heart is <i>broken</i> with you. Go to your room,
and stay there. I feel as if I could never endure the sight of you
again."</p>

<p>Beth gathered herself together slowly, and strolled away with an air of
indifference; but as soon as she found herself alone in her own room
with the door shut, she dropped on her knees and lifted her clasped
hands to heaven in an agony of remorse for having tormented her mother,
and in despair about that wretched engagement. "O Lord, what am I to
do?" she said; "what am I to do?" If she could make up her mind once for
all either way, she would be satisfied; it was this miserable state of
indecision that was unendurable.</p>

<p>Presently in the room below, she thought she heard her mother sob aloud.
She listened, breathless. Her mother was sobbing. Beth jumped up and
opened her door. What should she do? Her unhappy mother&mdash;heart-broken,
indeed. What a life hers was&mdash;a life of hard privation, of suffering
most patiently borne, of the utmost self-denial for her children's sake,
of loss, of loneliness, of bitter disappointment! First her husband
taken, then her dearest child; her ungrateful boys not over-kind to her;
and now this last blow dealt her by Beth, just when the prospect of
getting her well married was bringing a gleam of happiness into her
mother's life. The piteous sobs continued. Beth stole downstairs, bent
on atoning in her own person by any sacrifice for all the sorrows, no
matter by whom occasioned, which she felt were culminating in this final
outburst of grief. She found her mother standing beside the high
old-fashioned mantelpiece, leaning her poor head against it.</p>

<p>"Mamma," Beth cried, "do forgive me. I never meant to&mdash;I never meant to
hurt you so. I will do anything to please you. I was only teasing you
about kissing men. I haven't been in the habit of kissing any one. And
of course I'll marry Dan as soon as you like. And we'll all be
happy&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Caldwell held out her arms, and Beth sprang into them, and hugged
her tight and burst into tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> autumn Beth was married to Daniel Maclure,
 M.D., &amp;c., &amp;c. At the
time of her marriage she hardly knew what his full name was. She had
always heard him called "the doctor" or "Dr. Dan," and had never thought
of him as anything else, nor did she know anything else about him&mdash;his
past, his family, or his prospects, which, considering her age, is not
surprising; but what did surprise her in after years, when she
discovered it, was to find that her friends who made the match knew no
more about him than she did. He had scraped acquaintance with her
brother Jim in a public billiard-room in Rainharbour, and been
introduced by him to the other members of her family, who, because his
address was good and his appearance attractive, had taken it for granted
that everything else concerning him was equally satisfactory.</p>

<p>Beth decided to keep her surname for her father's sake, and also because
she could not see why she should lose her identity because she had
married. Everybody said it was absurd of her; but she was determined,
and from the time of her marriage she signed herself Elizabeth Caldwell
Maclure.</p>

<p>Dan confided to Mrs. Caldwell that he was troubled by some few small
debts which he was most anxious to pay in order that he might start his
married life clear, and the poor lady generously reduced her slender
income by selling some shares to raise the money for him. When he
accepted it, his eyes filled with tears, as was usual with him in
moments of emotion.</p>

<p>"O mamma!" Beth exclaimed when she heard of the sacrifice, "how could
you? I do not deserve such generosity, for I have never been any comfort
to you; and I shall always be miserable about it, thinking how badly you
want the money."</p>

<p>"There will be one mouth less to feed when you have gone, you know,
Beth," Mrs. Caldwell answered bravely, "and I shall be the happier for
thinking that you start clear. Debt crushed us our whole married life. I
shall be the easier if I know you haven't that burden to bear. Besides,
Dan will repay me as soon as he can. He is a thoroughly good fellow."</p>

<p>"You shall be repaid, mamma, in more ways than one, if I live," Beth
vowed.</p>

<p>Uncle James Patten doled out a five-pound-note to Beth by way of a
wedding present from the long rent-roll her mother should have
inherited.</p>

<p>"This is to help with your trousseau, but do not be extravagant," he
said in his pleasant way. "As the wife of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
 professional man, you will
descend from my class to the class below, the middle class, and you
should dress according to your station. But you are doing as well as we
could expect you to do, considering your character and conduct. Some
doubted if you would ever receive an offer of marriage, or have the
sense to accept it if one were made you; but I always said you would
have the doctor if he would have you."</p>

<p>Beth's impulse was to throw the note at him, but she restrained herself
on her brother Jim's account. It was suspected that Uncle James was only
waiting for a plausible excuse to disinherit Jim; and he found it the
next time Jim stayed at Fairholm. They were in the drawing-room together
one day, and a maid was mending the fire. Uncle James was sitting at a
writing-table with a mirror in front of him, and he declared that in
that mirror he distinctly saw his nephew chuck the maid-servant under
the chin, which was conduct such as Mr. James Patten could not be
expected to tolerate in his heir; so he altered his will, and after that
all communication ceased between the two families, except such as Aunt
Grace Mary managed to keep up surreptitiously.</p>

<p>Aunt Grace Mary was very generous to Beth, and so also was old Lady
Benyon. Had it not been for these two, Beth would have left home
ill-provided for. Thanks to them, however, she was spared that
humiliation, and went with an ample outfit.</p>

<p>In the days preceding her marriage, Beth sometimes thought of Charlotte,
and of the long fiction of that wonderful time when they were friends.
Her busy brain had created many another story since then, but none that
had the fascination of that first sustained effort. Hector's mysterious
establishment on the other side of the headland, the troubles in Spain,
the wicked machinations of their enemies, the Secret Service of
Humanity, the horses, yacht, and useful doctor&mdash;who had not held a high
place in their estimation, being merely looked upon as a trustworthy
tool of Hector's; yet it was he whom Beth was to marry. She wondered
what Charlotte would think of her when she heard it, and of Hector and
the whole story; but she never knew, for Charlotte was at school in
France during this period, and never came into Beth's life again.</p>

<p>During the early days of her married life a sort of content settled upon
Beth; a happy sense of well-being, of rest and satisfaction, came to
her, and that strange vague yearning ache, the presence of which made
all things incomplete, was laid. The atmosphere in which she now lived
was sensuous, not spiritual, and although she was unaware of this, she
felt its influence. Dan made much of her, and she liked that; but the
vision and the dream had ceased. Her intellectual activity was
stimulated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
 however, and it was not long before she began to think for
herself more clearly and connectedly than she had ever done before.</p>

<p>They spent the first few weeks in London in a whirl of excitement,
living at sumptuous restaurants, and going to places of amusement every
night, where Beth would sit entranced with music, singing, dancing, and
acting, never taking her eyes from the stage, and yearning in her
enthusiasm to do the same things herself&mdash;not doubting but that she
could either, so perfectly had she the power to identify herself with
the performers, and realise, as from within, what their sensations must
be.</p>

<p>When she had been in London as a girl at school, she had seen nothing
but the bright side of life, the wholesome, happy, young side. A poor
beggar to be helped, or a glimpse in the street of a sorrowful face that
saddened her for a moment, was the worst she knew of the great wicked
city; but now, with Dan for a companion, the realities of vice and crime
were brought home to her; she learnt to read signs of depravity in the
faces of men and women, and to associate certain places with evil-doers
as their especial haunts. Her husband's interest in the subject was
inexhaustible; he seemed to think of little else. He would point out
people in places of public amusement, and describe in detail the
loathsome lives they led. Every well-dressed woman he saw he suspected.
He would pick out one because she had yellow hair, and another because
her two little children were precocious and pretty, and declare them to
be "kept women." That a handsome woman could be anything but vicious had
apparently never occurred to him. He was very high-minded on the subject
of sin if the sinner were a woman, and thought no degradation sufficient
for her. In speaking of such women he used epithets from which Beth
recoiled. She allowed them to pass, however, in consideration of the
moral exasperation that inspired them, and the personal rectitude his
attitude implied. The subject had a horrible kind of fascination for
her; she hated it, yet she could not help listening, although her heart
ached and her soul sickened. She listened in silence, however, neither
questioning nor discussing, but simply attending; collecting material
for which she had no use at the moment, and storing it without
design&mdash;material which she would find herself forced to turn to account
eventually, but in what way and to what purpose there was no knowing as
yet.</p>

<p>They were to live at Slane, an inland town near Morningquest, where
modern manufactures had competed successfully with ancient agricultural
interests, and altered the attitude of the landed gentry towards trade,
and towards the townspeople, beguiling them to be less exclusive because
there was money in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
 the town, self-interest weighing with them all at
once in regard to the neighbours whom Christian precept had vainly urged
them to recognise.</p>

<p>Dr. Maclure had taken an old-fashioned house in a somewhat solitary
position on the outskirts of Slane, but near enough to the town to
secure paying patients, as he hoped, while far enough out of it to
invite county callers. It stood just on the highroad, from which it was
only divided by a few evergreen shrubs and an iron railing; but it was
picturesque, nevertheless, with creepers&mdash;magnolia, wisteria, and
ivy&mdash;clustering on the dark red bricks. At the back there was a good
garden, and in front, across the road, were green meadows with
hedgerows&mdash;a tangle of holly, hawthorn, and bramble&mdash;and old trees,
surviving giants of a forest long uprooted and forgotten. It was a rich
and placid scene, infinitely soothing to one fresh from the turmoil of
the city, and weary of the tireless motion, the incessant sound and
tumult of the sea. When Beth looked out upon the meadows first, she
sighed and said to herself, "Surely, surely one should be happy here!"</p>

<p>The house was inconveniently arranged inside, and had less accommodation
than its outside pretensions promised; but Beth was delighted with it
all, and took possession of her keys with pride. She was determined to
be a good manager, and make her housekeeping money go a long way. Her
dream was to save out of it, and have something over to surprise Dan
with when the bills were paid. To her chagrin, however, she found that
she was not to have any housekeeping money at all.</p>

<p>"You are too young to have the care of managing money," said Dan. "Just
give the orders, and I'll see about paying the bills."</p>

<p>But the system did not answer. Beth had no idea what she ought to be
spending, and either the bills were too high or the diet was too low,
and Dan grumbled perpetually. If the housekeeping were at all frugal, he
was anything but cheery during meals; but if she ordered him all he
wanted, there were sure to be scenes on the day of reckoning. He blamed
her bad management, and she said nothing; but she knew she could have
managed on any reasonable sum to which he might have limited her. She
had too much self-respect to ask for money, however, if he did not
choose to give it to her.</p>

<p>It surprised her to find that what he had to eat was a matter of great
importance to him. He fairly gloated over things he liked, and in order
to indulge him, and keep the bills down besides, she went without
herself; and he never noticed her self-denial. He was apt to take too
much of his favourite dishes, and was constantly regretting it. "I wish
I had not eaten so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
 much of that cursed <i>vol au vent</i>; it never agrees
with me," he would say; but he would eat as much as ever next time. Beth
could not help observing such traits. She did not set them down to his
personal discredit, however, but to the discredit of his sex at large.
She had always heard that men were self-indulgent, and Dan was a man;
that was the nearest she came to blaming him at first. Being her husband
had made a difference in her feeling for him; before their marriage she
was not so tolerant.</p>

<p>Her housekeeping duties by no means filled her day. An hour or so in the
morning was all they occupied at most, and the time must have hung heavy
on her hands had she had no other pursuit to beguile her. Fortunately
she had no intention of allowing her plans for the improvement of her
mind to lapse simply because she had married. On the contrary, she felt
the defects of her education more keenly than ever, and expected Dan to
sympathise with her in her efforts to remedy them. He came in one day
soon after they were settled, and found her sitting at the end of the
dining-room table with her back to the window and a number of books
spread out about her.</p>

<p>"This looks learned," he said. "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"I am looking for something to study," she answered. "What writers have
helped you most?"</p>

<p>"Helped me most!&mdash;how do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, helped you to be upright, you know, to make good resolutions and
keep straight."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said; "I have not felt the need of good resolutions, and
this is the first hint I have had that I require any. If you will
inquire among my friends, I fancy you will find that I have the credit
of going pretty straight as it is."</p>

<p>"O Dan!" Beth exclaimed, "you quite misunderstand me. I never meant to
insinuate that you are not straight. I was only thinking of the way in
which we all fall short of our ideals."</p>

<p>"Ideals be hanged!" said Dan. "If a man does his duty, that's ideal
enough, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I should think so," Beth said pacifically.</p>

<p>Dan went to the mantelpiece, and stood there, studying himself with
interest in the glass. "A lady told me the other day I looked like a
military man," he said, smoothing his glossy black hair and twisting the
ends of his long moustache.</p>

<p>"Well, I think you look much more military than medical," Beth replied,
considering him.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," he said, smiling at himself complacently.</p>

<p>"Are you?" Beth exclaimed in surprise. "Why? A medical man has a finer
career than a military man, and should have a finer presence if ability,
purpose, and character count for anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> towards appearance.
Personally I think I should wish to look like what I am, if I could
choose."</p>

<p>"So you do," he rejoined, adjusting his hat with precision as he spoke,
and craning his neck to see himself sideways in the glass. "You look
like a silly little idiot. But never mind. That's all a girl need be if
she's pretty; and if she isn't pretty, she's of no account, so it
doesn't matter what she is."</p>

<p>When he had gone, Beth sat for a long time thinking; but she did no more
reading that day, nor did she ever again consult Dan about the choice of
books, or expect him to sympathise with her in her work.</p>

<p>For the first few months of her married life, she had no pocket-money at
all. Aunt Grace Mary slipped two sovereigns into her hand when they
parted, but these Beth kept, she hardly knew why, as she had her
half-year's dividend to look forward to. About the time that her money
was due, Dan began to talk incessantly of money difficulties. Bills were
pressing, and he did not know where on earth to look for a
five-pound-note. He did not think Beth too young to be worried morning,
noon, and night on the subject, although she took it very seriously. One
morning after he had made her look anxious, he suddenly remembered a
letter he had for her, and handed it to her. It was from her lawyer, and
contained a cheque for twenty-five pounds, the long-looked-forward-to
pocket money.</p>

<p>"Will this be of any use to you?" Beth asked, handing him the cheque.</p>

<p>His countenance cleared. "Of use to me? I should think it would!" he
exclaimed. "It will just make all the difference. You must sign it,
though."</p>

<p>When she had signed it, he put it in his pocket-book, and his spirits
went up to the cheery point. He adjusted his hat at the glass over the
dining-room mantelpiece, lit a shilling cigar, and went off to his
hospital jauntily. Beth was glad to have relieved him of his anxiety.
She half hoped he might give her something out of the cheque, if it were
only a pound or two, she wanted some little things so badly; but he
never offered her a penny. She thought of Aunt Grace Mary's two
sovereigns, but the dread of having nothing in case of an emergency kept
her from spending them.</p>

<p>There was one thing Dan did which Beth resented. He opened her letters.</p>

<p>"Husband and wife are one," he said. "They should have no secrets from
each other. I should like you to open my letters, too, but they contain
professional secrets, you see, and that wouldn't do."</p>

<p>He spoke in what he called his cheery way, but Beth had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> begun to feel
that there was another word which would express his manner better, and
now it occurred to her.</p>

<p>"You have no right to open my letters," she said; "and being facetious
on the subject does not give you any."</p>

<p>"But if I chose to?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It will be a breach of good taste and good feeling," she answered.</p>

<p>No more was said on the subject, and Dan did not open her letters for a
little, but then he began again. He had always some excuse,
however&mdash;either he hadn't looked at the address, or he had been
impatient to see if there were any message for himself, and so on; but
Beth was not mollified although she said nothing, and her annoyance made
her secretive. She would watch for the postman, and take the letters
from him herself, and conceal her own, so that Dan might not even know
that she had received any.</p>

<p>She had a difficulty with him about another matter too. His lover-like
caresses while they were engaged had not been distasteful to her; but
after their marriage he kept up an incessant billing and cooing, and of
a coarser kind, which soon satiated her. She was a nicely balanced
creature, with many interests in life, and love could be but one among
the number in any case; but Dan almost seemed to expect it to be the
only one.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! must I be embraced again?" she exclaimed one day, with quite
comical dismay on being interrupted in the middle of a book that was
interesting her at the moment.</p>

<p>Dan looked disconcerted. In his cheerful masculine egotism it had not
occurred to him that Beth might find incessant demonstrations of
affection monotonous. He would smile at pictures of the waning of the
honeymoon, where the husband returns to his book and his dog, and the
wife sits apart sad and neglected; it was inevitable that the man should
tire, he had other things to think of; but that the wife should be the
first to be bored was incredible, and worse: it was unwomanly.</p>

<p>Dan went to the mantelpiece, and stood looking down into the fire, and
his grey-green eyes became suffused.</p>

<p>"Have I hurt you, Dan?" Beth exclaimed, jumping up and going to him.</p>

<p>"Hurt me!" he said, taking out his pocket-handkerchief, "that is not the
word for it. You have made me very unhappy."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Beth, her own inclinations disregarded at once, "I <i>am</i>
sorry!"</p>

<p>But he had satiated her once for all, and she never recovered any zest
for his caresses. She found no charm or freshness in them, especially
after she perceived that they were for his own gratification,
irrespective of hers. The privileges of love are not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span> to be wrested from
us with impunity. Habits of dutiful submission destroy the power to
respond, and all that they leave to survive of the warm reality of love
at last is a cold pretence. By degrees, as Beth felt forced to be
dutiful, she ceased to be affectionate.</p>

<p>Although Dan dressed to go out with scrupulous care, he took no trouble
to make himself nice in the house. Care in dress was not in him a
necessary part and expression of a refined nature, but an attempt to win
consideration. He never dressed for dinner when they were alone
together. It was a trouble rather than a refreshment to him to get rid
of the dust of the day and the associations of his walking-dress. This
was a twofold disappointment to Beth. She had expected him to have the
common politeness to dress for her benefit, and she was not pleased to
find that the punctiliousness he displayed in the matter on occasion was
merely veneer. It was a defect of breeding that struck her unpleasantly.
They had been poor enough at home, but Beth had been accustomed all her
life to have delicate china about her, and pictures and books, to walk
on soft carpets and sit in easy-chairs; possessions of a superior class
which, in her case, were symbols bespeaking refinement of taste and
habits from which her soul had derived satisfaction even while her poor
little fragile body starved. She dressed regularly and daintily herself,
and Dan at the bottom of the table in his morning coat was an offence to
her. She said nothing at first, however, so his manners still further
deteriorated, until one night, after she had gone to her room, he walked
in with his hat on, smoking a cigar. It was this last discourtesy that
roused her to rebel.</p>

<p>"This is my bedroom," she said significantly.</p>

<p>"I know," he answered.</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;yet you keep your hat on, and you are smoking," she
proceeded.</p>

<p>"Why," he rejoined, "and if I do, what then? I know ladies who let their
husbands smoke in bed."</p>

<p>"Probably," she said. "I have heard of more singularly coarse things
than that even. But I am accustomed to pure air in my room, and I must
have it."</p>

<p>"And suppose I should choose to stay here and smoke?" he said.</p>

<p>"Of course I could not prevent you," she answered; "but I should go and
sleep in another room."</p>

<p>"H'm," he grunted. "You're mighty particular."</p>

<p>But he went away all the same, and did not appear there again either
with his hat on or smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>Beth suffered miserably from the want of proper privacy in her life. She
had none whatever now. It had been her habit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
 to read and reflect when
she went to bed, to prepare for a tranquil night by setting aside the
troubles of the day, and purifying her mind systematically even as she
washed her body; but all that was impossible if her husband were at
home. He would break in upon her reading with idle gossip, fidget about
the room when she wished to meditate, and leave her no decent time of
privacy for anything. He had his own dressing-room, where he was secure
from interruption, but never had the delicacy to comprehend that his
presence could be any inconvenience to Beth. And it was worse than an
inconvenience. It was a positive hardship&mdash;never to be sure of a moment
alone.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when she had locked herself in her bedroom, he came and
turned the handle of the door noisily.</p>

<p>"Open the door," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you want anything?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Open the door," he repeated.</p>

<p>She obeyed, and he came in, and glanced round suspiciously.</p>

<p>"What were you doing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, "this is intolerable!"</p>

<p>"What is intolerable?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"This intrusion," she replied. "I want to be alone for a little; can't
you understand that?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot understand a wife locking her husband out of her room, and
what's more, you've no business to do it. I've a legal right to come
here whenever I choose."</p>

<p>Then Beth began to realise what the law of man was with regard to her
person.</p>

<p>"I never intrude upon you when you shut yourself up," she remonstrated.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is different," he answered arrogantly. "I may have brainwork
to do, or something important to think about There is no comparison."</p>

<p>Beth went to her dressing-table, sat down in front of it, folded her
hands, and waited doggedly.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a little; then he said, "I don't understand your
treatment of me at all, Beth. But there's no understanding women." He
spoke as if it were the women's fault, and to their discredit, that he
couldn't understand them.</p>

<p>Beth made no answer, and he finally took himself off, slamming the door
after him.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" Beth exclaimed. "One would think he had bought me."</p>

<p>Then she sat wondering what she should do. She must have some corner
where she would be safe from intrusion. He had his consulting-room, a
room called his laboratory, a surgery, and a dressing-room, where no one
would dream of following him if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
 he shut the door; she had literally not
a corner. She left her bedroom, and walked through the other rooms on
the same floor as she considered the matter; then she went up to the
next floor, where the servants slept. Above that again there was an
attic used as a box-room, and she went up there too. It was a barn of a
place, supported by pillars, and extending apparently over the whole of
the storey below. The roof sloped to the floor on either side, and the
whole place was but ill-lighted by two small windows looking to the
north. Dr. Maclure had taken over the house as it stood, furniture and
all, from the last occupants, by whom this great attic had evidently
been used as a lumber-room. There were various pieces of furniture in
it&mdash;tables, chairs, and drawers, some broken, some in fair condition. At
the farther end, opposite to the door, there was a pile of packing-cases
and travelling-trunks. Beth had always thought that they stood up
against the wall, but on going over to them now, she discovered that
there was a space behind. The pile was too high for her to see over it,
but by going down on her hands and knees where the sloping roof was too
low for her to stoop, she found she could creep round it. It was the
kind of thing a child would have done, but what was Beth but a child? On
the other side of the pile it was almost dark. She could see something,
however, when she stood up, which looked like a mark on the whitewash,
and on running her hand over it she discovered it to be a narrow door
flush with the wall. There was no handle or latch to it, but there was a
key which had rusted in the keyhole and was not to be turned. The door
was not locked, however, and Beth pushed it open, and found herself in a
charming little room with a fireplace at one end of it, and opposite, at
the other end, a large bow window. Beth was puzzled to understand how
there came to be a room there at all. Then she recollected a sort of
tower there was at the side of the house, which formed a deep embrasure
in the drawing-room, a dressing-room to the visitor's room, and a
bath-room on the floor above. The window looked out on the garden at the
back of the house. A light iron balcony ran round it, the rail of which
was so thickly covered with ivy that very little of the window was
visible from below. Beth had noticed it, however, only she thought it
was a dummy, and so also did Dan. The little room looked bright and cosy
with the afternoon sun streaming in. It seemed to have been occupied at
one time by some person of fastidious taste, judging by what furniture
remained&mdash;a square Chippendale table with slender legs, two high-backed
chairs covered with old-fashioned tapestry, and a huge mahogany bookcase
of the same period, with glass doors above and cupboards below. The high
white mantelpiece, adorned with vases and festoons of flowers, was of
Adam's design,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
 and so also was the dado and the cornice. The walls were
painted a pale warm pink. A high brass fender, pierced, surrounded the
fireplace, and there were a poker, tongs, and shovel to match, and a
small brass scuttle still full of coals. There were ashes in the grate,
too, as if the room had only lately been occupied. The boards were bare,
but white and well-fitting, and in one corner of the room there was a
piece of carpet rolled up.</p>

<p>Beth dropped on to one of the dusty chairs, and looked round. Everything
about her was curiously familiar, and her first impression was that she
had been there before. On the other hand, she could hardly believe in
the reality of what she saw, she thought she must be dreaming, for here
was exactly what she had been pining for most in the whole wide world of
late, a secret spot, sacred to herself, where she would be safe from
intrusion.</p>

<p>She went downstairs for some oil for the lock, and patiently worked at
it until at last she succeeded in turning the key. Then, as it was too
late to do anything more that day, she locked the door, and carried the
key off in her pocket triumphantly.</p>

<p>Half the night she lay awake thinking of her secret chamber; and as soon
as Dan had gone out next morning, and she had done her housekeeping, she
stole upstairs with duster and brush, and began to set it in order. All
her treasures were contained in some old trunks of Aunt Victoria's which
were in the attic, but had not been unpacked because she had no place to
put the things. Dan had seen some of these treasures at Rainharbour, and
considered them old rubbish, and, not thinking it likely that there
would be anything else in the boxes, he had taken no further interest in
them. He would have liked to have left them behind altogether, and even
tried to laugh Beth out of what he called her sentimental attachment to
odds and ends; but as most of the things had belonged to Aunt Victoria,
she took his ridicule so ill that he wisely let the subject drop. He had
been somewhat hasty in his estimation of the value of the contents of
the boxes, however, for there were some handsome curios, a few
miniatures and pictures of great artistic merit, some rare editions of
books, besides laces, jewels, brocades, and other stuffs in them.</p>

<p>When Beth had swept and dusted, she put down the carpet. Then she began
to unpack. Among the first things she found were the old French books, a
quarto Bible with the Apocrypha in it, Shakespeare in several volumes,
and her school-books and note-books; some ornaments, some beautiful old
curtains, and a large deep rug, like a Turkey carpet, in crimson and
green and purple and gold, worked by Aunt Victoria. This she spread
before the fireplace. The doorway she covered with a curtain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> and two
more she hung on either side of the window, so that they could not be
seen from below. Her books of reference, desk, note-books, and writing
materials she put on the table, arranged the ornaments on the
mantelpiece, and hung the miniatures and pictures on the walls. Then she
sat down and looked about her, well pleased with the whole effect.
"Now," she exclaimed, "I am at home, thank God! I shall be able to
study, to read and write, think and pray at last, undisturbed."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Dan sympathised with none of Beth's tastes
 or interests, and seemed
to have none of his own with which she could sympathise, their stock of
conversation was soon exhausted, and there was nothing like
companionship in their intercourse. If Beth had had no resources in
herself, she would have had but a sorry time of it in those days,
especially as she received no kindness from any one in Slane. Some of
the other medical men's wives called when she first arrived, and she
returned their calls punctually, but their courtesy went no farther.
Mrs. Carne, the wife of the leading medical practitioner, asked her to
lunch, and Mrs. Jeffreys, a surgeon's wife, asked her to afternoon tea;
but as these invitations did not include her husband, she refused them.
She invited these ladies and their husbands in return, however, but they
both pleaded previous engagements.</p>

<p>After the Maclures had been some little time at Slane, Lady Benyon
bethought her of an old friend of hers, one Lady Beg, who lived in the
neighbourhood, and asked her to call upon Beth, which she did forthwith,
for she was one of those delightful old ladies who like nothing better
than to be doing a kindness. She came immediately, bringing an
invitation to lunch on the following Sunday, already written in case she
should find no one at home.</p>

<p>Dan was delighted, "We shall meet nothing but county people there," he
said, "and that's the proper set for us. They always do the right thing,
you see. They're the only people worth knowing."</p>

<p>"But Beg is miles away from here," Beth said; "how shall we go?"</p>

<p>"We'll go in the dogcart, of course," Dan answered.</p>

<p>He had set up a dogcart on their arrival, but this was the first time he
had proposed to take Beth out in it.</p>

<p>As they drove along on Sunday morning in the bright sunshine, Dan's
spirits overflowed in a characteristic way at the prospect of meeting
"somebody decent," as he expressed it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
 he made remarks about the
faces and figures of all the women they passed on the road, criticising
them as if they were cattle to be sold at so much a point.</p>

<p>"That little girl there," he said of one, whom he beamed upon and ogled
as they passed, "reminds me of a fair-haired little devil I picked up
one night in Paris. Gad! she <i>was</i> a bad un! up to more tricks than any
other I ever knew. She used to&mdash;" (here followed a description of some
of her peculiar practices).</p>

<p>"I wish you would not tell me these things," Beth remonstrated.</p>

<p>But he only laughed. "You know you're amused," he said. "It's just your
conventional affectation that makes you pretend to object. That's the
way women drive their husbands elsewhere for amusement; they won't take
a proper intelligent interest in life, so there's nothing to talk to
them about. I agree with the advanced party. They're always preaching
that women should know the world. Women who <i>do</i> know the world have no
nonsense about them, and are a jolly sight better company than your
starched Puritans who pretend to know nothing. It's the most interesting
side of life after all, and the most instructive; and I wonder at your
want of intelligence, Beth. You shouldn't be afraid to know the natural
history of humanity."</p>

<p>"Nor am I," Beth answered quietly; "nor the natural&mdash;or
unnatural&mdash;depravity either, which is what you really mean, I believe.
But knowing it, and delighting in it as a subject of conversation, are
two very different things. Jesting about that side of life affects me
like mud on a clean coat. I resent being splashed with it, and try to
get rid of it, but unfortunately it sticks and stains."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're quite right," Dan answered unctuously. "It's just shocking
the stories that are told&mdash;" and for the rest of the way he discoursed
about morals, illustrating his meaning as he proceeded with anecdotes of
the choicest description.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Beg House, they found the company more mixed than
Dan had anticipated. Dr. and Mrs. Carne were there, Mr. and Mrs.
Jeffreys, and Mr., Mrs., and Miss Petterick. Mr. Petterick was a
solicitor of bumptious manners and doubtful reputation, whom the whole
county hated, but tolerated because of his wealth and shrewdness, either
of which they liked to be in a position to draw upon if necessary. But
besides these townspeople, there were Sir George and Lady Galbraith, Mr.
and Mrs. Kilroy of Ilverthorpe, and Mrs. Orton Beg, a widowed
daughter-in-law of Lady Beg's.</p>

<p>Dr. Maclure immediately made up to Sir George Galbraith, who was also a
medical man, and of great repute in his own line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> He was a county
magnate besides, and a man of wealth and importance by reason of a
baronetcy somewhat unexpectedly inherited, and a beautiful country-seat.
He continued to practise, however, for love of his profession, but used
it as a means of doing good rather than as a source of income. In
appearance he was a tall, rather awkward man, with a fine head and a
strong, plain face. He spoke in that deliberate Scotch way which has a
ring of sincerity in it and inspires confidence, and the contrast
between his manner and Dan's struck Beth unpleasantly. She wished Dan
would be less effusive; it was almost as if he were cringing; and she
thought he should have waited for Sir George Galbraith, who was the
older man, to have made the first advance.</p>

<p>Beth herself was at her ease as soon as she came among these people. It
was the social atmosphere to which she had been accustomed. Mrs. Carne,
Mrs. Jeffreys, and Mrs. Petterick were on their best behaviour, but Beth
had only to be natural. The county people were all nice to her, and the
other town ladies, who had hitherto slighted her, looked on and wondered
to see her so well received. At luncheon, as there were not gentlemen
enough to go round, she sat between Sir George Galbraith and Mrs. Orton
Beg. Mrs. Kilroy sat opposite. Sir George had known Mrs. Kilroy all her
life. It was he, in fact, who nicknamed her and her brother "The
Heavenly Twins" in the days when, as children, they used to be the
delight of their grandfather, the old Duke of Morningquest, and the
terror of their parents, Mr. and Lady Adeline Hamilton-Wells.</p>

<p>As soon as they were seated, Mrs. Kilroy attacked Sir George on some
subject which they had previously discussed, and there ensued a little
playful war of words.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're just a phrase-maker," Mrs. Kilroy exclaimed at last, finding
herself worsted; "and phrases prove nothing."</p>

<p>"What is a phrase-maker?" he asked with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"Why, a phrase-maker is a person who recklessly launches a saying,
winged by wit, and of superior brevity and distinctness, but not
necessarily true&mdash;a saying which flies direct to the mind, and, being of
a cutting nature, carves an indelible impression there," said Mrs.
Kilroy&mdash;"an impression which numbs the intellect and prevents us
reasoning for ourselves. Opinion is formed for the most part of phrases,
not of knowledge and observation. The things people say smartly are
quoted, not because they are true, but because they are smart. A lie
well put will carry conviction to the average mind more surely than a
good reason if ill-expressed, because most people have an &aelig;sthetic sense
that is satisfied by a happy play upon words, but few have reason enough
to discriminate when the brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
 ingenuity of the phrase-maker is
pitted against a plain statement of the bald truth."</p>

<p>"As, for instance?" asked Sir George.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Man's love is of his life a thing apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis woman's whole existence,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Kilroy responded glibly. "That is quoted everywhere, and I have
never heard it questioned, yet it is a flagrant case of confounding
smartness with accuracy. Love of the kind that Byron meant is quite as
much a thing apart from woman's life as from man's; more men, in fact,
make the pursuit of it their whole existence than women do."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Sir George thoughtfully. "Love is certainly not a
modern woman's whole existence, and she never dies of it. She feels it
strongly, but it does not swamp her. In a bad attack, she may go to bed
young one night and rise next day with grey hairs in her head, and write
a book about it; but then she recovers: and I think you are right about
phrases, too. 'Syllables govern the world,' John Selden said; but
'phrases' would have been the better word. Phrases are the keynotes to
life; they set the tune to which men insensibly shape their course, and
so rule us for good and ill. This is a time of talk, and formidable is
the force of phrases. Catch-words are creative; they do not prove that a
thing is&mdash;they cause it to be."</p>

<p>"Then an unscrupulous phrase-maker may be a danger to the community,"
Beth observed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sir George; "but on the other hand, one who is scrupulous
would be a philanthropist of extraordinary power."</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that like his craft and subtlety, Evadne?" said Mrs. Kilroy
to Lady Galbraith. "He has been gradually working up to that in order to
make Mrs. Maclure suppose I intended to pay him a compliment when I
called him a phrase-maker."</p>

<p>"You are taking a mean advantage of an honest attempt on my part to
arrive at the truth," said Sir George.</p>

<p>"I believe you blundered into that without seeing in the least where you
were going," Beth observed na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>Everybody smiled, except Dan, who told her on the way home she had made
a great mistake to say such a thing, and she must be careful in future,
or she would give offence and make enemies for him.</p>

<p>"No fear with people like that," said Beth. "They all understood me."</p>

<p>"Which is as much as to say that your husband does not," said Dan,
assuming his hurt expression. "Very well. Go your own way. But you'll be
sorry for it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a delightful person Mrs. Orton Beg is," Beth observed, to make a
diversion; "and so nice-looking too!"</p>

<p>"You are easily pleased! Why, she's forty if she's a day!" Dan
ejaculated, speaking as if that were to her discredit, and must deprive
her of any consideration from him.</p>

<p>The next excitement was a military ball. Dan determined to go, and Beth
was ready enough; she had never been to a ball.</p>

<p>"But how about a dress?" she said. "There has been such a sudden change
in the fashion since mine were made, I'm afraid I have nothing that will
do."</p>

<p>"Then get a new one," Dan said.</p>

<p>"What! and add to the bills?" Beth objected.</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the bills!" he answered in the tone he called cheery. "I've
had them coming in all my life and I'm still here. Get a thing when you
want it, and pay for it when you can&mdash;that's my motto. Why, my tailor's
bill alone is up in the hundreds.</p>

<p>"But that was the bill mamma gave you the money to settle," Beth
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I know," he answered casually. "I got the money out of her for that,
but I had to spend it on your amusement in town, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Beth ejaculated&mdash;"how could you?"</p>

<p>"How could I?" he answered coolly. "Well, I couldn't of course if I
hadn't been clever; but I can always get anything I like out of old
ladies. They dote on me. You've only got to amuse them, you know, and
pour in a little sentiment on occasion. Let them understand you've been
rather a naughty man, but you know what's right&mdash;that always fetches
them. Your mother would have sold out all she had to help me when she
found I meant to repent and settle. But of course I wouldn't take
anything that was not absolutely necessary," he added magnanimously.</p>

<p>Beth compressed her lips and frowned. "Do you mean to say you obtained
money from a poor woman like my mother for a special purpose which she
approved, and spent that money on something else?" she asked.</p>

<p>Dan changed countenance. "I got the money from your mother to pay my
tailor's bill; but the circumstance of your spending more money in town
than I could afford compelled me to use it for another purpose," he
answered in rather a blustering tone.</p>

<p>"I spent no money in town," Beth said.</p>

<p>"I had to spend it on you then," he rejoined, "and a nice lament you
would have made if I hadn't! But it's all the same. Husband and wife are
one; and I maintain that the money was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
 given to me to pay a just debt,
and I paid a just debt with it. Now, what have you to say against that
to the disparagement of your husband?"</p>

<p>He looked Beth straight in the face as he spoke, as if the nature of the
transaction would be changed by staring her out of countenance, and she
returned his gaze unflinchingly; but not another word would she say on
the subject. There is a sad majority of wives whose attitude towards
their husbands must be one of contemptuous toleration&mdash;toleration of
their past depravity and of their present deceits, whatever form they
may take. Such a wife looks upon her husband as a hopeless incurable,
because she knows that he has not the sense, even if he had the strength
of character, to mend his moral defects. Beth fully realised her
husband's turpitude with regard to the money, and also realised the
futility of trying to make him see his own conduct in the matter in any
light not flattering to himself, and she was deeply pained. She had
taken it for granted that Dan would pay interest on the money, but had
not troubled herself to find out if he were doing so, as she now thought
that she ought to have done, for clearly she should have paid it herself
if he did not. True, she never had any money; but that was no excuse,
for there were honest ways of making money, and make it she would. She
was on her way upstairs to her secret chamber to think the matter out
undisturbed when she came to this determination; and as soon as she had
shut herself in, she sank upon her knees, and vowed to God solemnly to
pay back every farthing, and the interest in full, if she had to work
her fingers to the bone. Curiously enough, it was with her fingers she
first thought of working, not with her brain. She had seen an
advertisement in a daily paper of several dep&ocirc;ts for the sale of
"ladies' work" in London and other places, and she determined at once to
try that method of making money. Work of all kinds came easily to her,
and happily she still had her two sovereigns, which would be enough to
lay in a stock of materials to begin with. Her pin-money Dan regularly
appropriated as soon as it arrived, with the facetious remark that it
would just pay for her keep; and so far Beth had let him have it without
a murmur, yielding in that as in all else, however much against her own
inclinations, for gentleness, and also with a vague notion of making up
to him in some sort for his own shortcomings, which she could not help
fancying must be as great a trouble to him as they were to her. She had
grown to have a very real affection for Dan, as indeed she would have
had for any one who was passably kind to her; but her estimate of his
character, as she gradually became acquainted with it, was never
influenced by her affection, except in so far as she pitied him for
traits which would have made her despise another man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>Since her marriage she had given up her free, wild, wandering habits.
She would go into the town to order things at the shops in the morning,
and take a solitary walk out into the country in the afternoon perhaps,
but without any keen enjoyment. Her natural zest for the woods and
fields was suspended. She had lost touch with nature. Instead of looking
about her observantly, as had been her wont, she walked now, as a rule,
with her eyes fixed on the ground, thinking deeply. She was losing
vitality too; her gait was less buoyant, and she was becoming subject to
aches and pains she had never felt before. Dan said they were neuralgic,
and showed that she wanted a tonic, but troubled himself no more about
them. He always seemed to think she should be satisfied when he found a
name for her complaint. She had also become much thinner, which made her
figure childishly young; but in the face she looked old for her
age&mdash;five-and-twenty at least&mdash;although she was not yet eighteen.</p>

<p>There was one particularly strong and happy point in Beth's character:
she wasted little or no time in repining for the thing that was done.
All her thought was how to remedy the evil and make amends; so now, when
she had recovered from the first shock of her husband's revelation, she
put the thought of it aside, pulled herself together quickly, and found
relief in setting to work with a will. The exertion alone was
inspiriting, and re-aroused the faculty which had been dormant in her of
late. She went at once to get materials for her work, and stepped out
more briskly than she had done for many a day. She perceived that the
morning air was fresh and sweet, and she inhaled deep draughts of it,
and rejoiced in the sunshine. Just opposite their house, across the
road, on the other side of a wooden paling, the park-like meadow was
intensely green; old horse-chestnuts dotted about it made refreshing
intervals of shade; in the hedgerows the tall elms stood out clear
against the sky, and the gnarled oaks cast fantastic shadows on the
grass; while beyond it, at the farther side of the meadow by the brook,
the row of Canadian poplars which bordered it kept up a continuous
whispering, as was their wont, even on the stillest days. When Beth
first heard them, they spoke a language to her which she comprehended
but could not translate; but the immediate effect of her life with Dan
had been to deaden her perception, so that she could not comprehend.
Then the whispering became a mere rustle of leaves, appealing to nothing
but her sense of hearing, and her delight in their murmur lapsed when
its significance was lost to her spirit.</p>

<p>But that morning Nature spoke to her again and her eyes were opened. She
saw the grey-green poplars, the gnarled oaks, the dark crests of the
elms upraised against the radiant blue of the sky, and felt a thrill
like triumph as she watched the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
 masses of cloud, dazzlingly
white, floating in infinite space majestically. The life about her,
too&mdash;the twittering of birds in the hedgerows; an Alderney cow with its
calf in the fields; a young colt careering wildly, startled by a passing
train; a big dog that saluted her with friendly nose as he trotted
by&mdash;all these said something to her which made her feel that, let what
might happen, it was good to be alive.</p>

<p>On her way into town she thought out a piece of work, something more
original and effective than the things usually sold in fancy-work shops,
which did not often please her. When she had bought all the materials
that she required, there was very little of her two pounds left, but she
returned in high spirits, carrying the rather large parcel herself,
lest, if it were sent, it should arrive when Dan was at home and excite
his curiosity. He always appeared if he heard the door-bell ring, and
insisted on knowing who or what had come, an inquisitive trick that
irritated Beth into baffling him whenever she could.</p>

<p>She carried her precious packet up to her secret chamber, and set to
work at once. Dan, when he came in to lunch, was surprised to find her
unusually cheerful. After the temper she had displayed at breakfast, he
had expected to have anything but a pleasant time of it for a little.
Seeing her in good spirits put him also into a genial mood, and he began
at once to talk about himself&mdash;his favourite topic.</p>

<p>"Well, I've had a rattling hard day," he observed. "You'd be surprised
at the amount I've done in the time. I don't believe any other man here
could have done it. I was at that confounded hospital a couple of hours,
and after that I had a round! People are beginning to send for me now as
the last from school. They think I'm up to the latest dodges. The old
men won't like it! I had to go out to the Pettericks to see that girl
Bertha again. Their family doctor could make nothing of her case, but
it's simple enough. The girl's hysterical, that's what she is; and I
know what I'd like to prescribe for her, and that's a husband. Hee-hee!
Soon cure her hysterics! As to the old girl, her mother, she's
got"&mdash;then followed a minute description of her ailments, told in the
baldest language. Of two words Dan always chose the coarsest in talking
to Beth, now that they were married, which had made her writhe at first;
but when she had remonstrated, he assumed an injured air, after which
she silently endured the infliction for fear of wounding him. And it was
the same with regard to his patients. The first time he described the
ailment of a lady patient, and made gross comments about her, Beth had
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Dan! what would she think of you if she knew you had told me? Surely
it is a breach of confidence!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," he exclaimed, trying to wither her with a look, "you <i>have</i> a
nice opinion of your husband! Is it possible that I cannot speak to my
own wife without bringing such an accusation upon myself! Well, well!
And I'm slaving for you morning, noon, and night, to keep you in some
sort of decency and comfort; and when I come home, and do my best to be
cheery and amuse you, instead of being morose after the strain of the
day, as most men are, all the thanks I get is a speech like that! O holy
matrimony!"</p>

<p>"I did not mean to annoy you, Dan; I'm sorry," Beth protested.</p>

<p>"So you should be!" he said; "so you should be! It's mighty hard for me
to feel that my own wife hasn't confidence enough in me to be sure that
I should never say a word either to her or anybody else about any of my
patients to which they'd object."</p>

<p>"People feel differently on the subject, perhaps," Beth ventured. "I
only know that if I had a doctor who talked to his wife about my
complaints, I should"&mdash;despise him, was what she was going to say, but
she changed the phrase&mdash;"I should not like it. But you should know what
your own patients feel about it better than I do."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, however, her mother's remark of long ago about a
"talking doctor" recurred to her, and she felt lowered in her own
estimation by the kind of concession she was making to him. The tragedy
of such a marriage consists in the effect of the man's mind upon the
woman's, shut up with him in the closest intimacy day and night, and all
the time imbibing his poisoned thoughts. Beth's womanly grace pleaded
with her continually not to hurt her husband since he meant no offence,
not to damp his spirits even when they took a form so distasteful to
her. To check him was to offend him and provoke a scene for nothing,
since his taste was not to be improved; and she would have to have
checked him perpetually, and made a mere nag of herself; for to talk in
this way to her, to tell her objectionable stories, and harp on
depravity of all kinds, was his one idea of pleasurable conversation. It
was seldom, therefore, that she remonstrated&mdash;especially in those early
days when she had not as yet perceived that by tacitly acquiescing she
was lending herself to inevitable corruption.</p>

<p>Just at that time, too, she did not trouble herself much about anything.
She was entirely absorbed in her new object in life&mdash;to get the work
done, to make the money, to pay her mother with interest; there was
continual exaltation of spirit in the endeavour. Every moment that she
could safely secure, she spent in her secret chamber, hard at work. Her
outlook was on the sky above, for ever changing; on the gay garden
below,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
 whence light airs wafted the fragrance of flowers from time to
time, to her delight; and on a gentle green ascent, covered and crowned
with trees, which shut out the world beyond. Here there was a colony of
rooks, where the birds were busy all day long sometimes, and from which
they were sometimes absent from early morning till sundown, when they
came back cawing by ones and twos and threes, a long straggling
procession of them, their dark iridescent forms with broad black wings
outspread, distinct and decorative, against the happy blue. Beth loved
the birds, and even as she worked she watched them, their housekeepings
and comings and goings; and heard their talk; and often as she worked
she looked out at the fair prospect and up at the sky hopefully, and
vowed again to accomplish one act of justice at all events. She stopped
her regular studies at this time, because she conceived them to be for
her own mere personal benefit, while the task which she had set herself
was for a better purpose. But, although she did not study as had been
her wont, while she sewed she occupied her mind in a way that was much
more beneficial to it than the purposeless acquisition of facts, the
solving of mathematical problems, or conning of parts of speech. Beside
her was always an open book, it might be a passage of Scripture, a scene
from Shakespeare, a poem or paragraph rich in the wisdom and beauty of
some great mind; and as she sewed she dwelt upon it, repeating it to
herself until she was word-perfect in it, then making it even more her
own by earnest contemplation. These passages became the texts of many
observations; and in them was also the light which showed her life as it
is, and as it should be lived. In meditating upon them she taught
herself to meditate; and in following up the clues they gave her in the
endeavour to discriminate and to judge fairly, by slow degrees she
acquired the precious habit of clear thought. This lifted her at once
above herself as she had been; and what she had lost of insight and
spiritual perception since her marriage, she began to recover in another
and more perfect form. Wholesome consideration of the realities of life
now took the place of fanciful dreams. Her mind, wonderfully fertilised,
teemed again&mdash;not with vain imaginings, however, as heretofore, but with
something more substantial. Purposeful thought was where the mere froth
of sensuous seeing had been; and it was thought that now clamoured for
expression instead of the verses and stories&mdash;fireworks of the brain,
pleasant, transient, futile distractions with nothing more nourishing in
them than the interest and entertainment of the moment&mdash;which had
occupied her chiefly from of old. It was natural to Beth to be open, to
discuss all that concerned herself with her friends; but having no one
to talk to now, she began on a sudden to record her thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> and
impressions in writing; and having once begun, she entered upon a new
phase of existence altogether. She had discovered a recreation which was
more absorbing than anything she had ever tried before; for her early
scribbling had been of another kind, not nearly so entrancing. Then it
had been the idle gossip of life, and the mere pictorial art of
word-painting, an ingenious exercise, that had occupied her; now it was
the more soul-stirring themes in the region of philosophy and ethics
which she pursued, and scenes and phases of life interested her only as
the raw material from which a goodly moral might be extracted. Art for
art's sake she despised, but in art for man's sake she already
discovered noble possibilities. But her very delight in her new pursuit
made her think it right to limit her indulgence in it. Duty she
conceived to be a painful effort necessarily, but writing was a
pleasure; she therefore attended first conscientiously to her
embroidery, and any other task she thought it right to perform, although
her eager impatience to get back to her desk made each in turn a toil to
her. Like many another earnest person, she mistook the things of no
importance for things that matter because the doing of them cost her
much; and it was the intellectual exercise, the delicate fancy work of
her brain, a matter of enormous consequence, that she neglected. Not
knowing that "<i>If a man love the labour of any trade, apart from any
question of success or fame, the gods have called him</i>," she made the
fitting of herself for the work of her life her last exercise at the
tired end of the day. She rose early and went to bed late in order to
gain a little more time to write, but never suspected that her delight
in the effort to find expression for what was in her mind of itself
proclaimed her one of the elect.</p>

<p>When she had finished her embroidery, she despatched it secretly to the
dep&ocirc;t in London; but then she found that she would have to pay a small
subscription before she could have it sold there, and she had no money.
She wrote boldly to the secretary and told her so, and asked if the
subscription could not be paid out of the price she got for her work.
The secretary replied that it was contrary to the rules, but the
committee thought that such an artistically beautiful design as hers was
sure to be snapped up directly, and they had therefore decided to make
an exception in her case.</p>

<p>While these letters were going backwards and forwards, Beth suffered
agonies of anxiety lest Dan should pounce upon them and discover her
secret; but he happened to be out always at post-time just then, so she
managed to secure them safely.</p>

<p>As she had no money, she could not buy any more materials for
embroidery, so she was obliged to take a holiday, the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> part of
which she spent in writing. She was deeply engrossed by thoughts on
progress, which had been suggested by a passage in one of Emerson's
essays: "<i>All conservatives are such from natural defects. They have
been effeminated by position or nature, born halt and blind, through
luxury of their parents, and can only, like invalids, act on the
defensive.</i>" Even in her own little life Beth had seen so much of the
ill effects of conservatism in the class to which she belonged, and had
suffered so much from it herself already, that the subject appealed to
her strongly, and she pursued it with enthusiasm&mdash;more from the social
than the political point of view, however. But, unfortunately, in all
too short a time, her holiday came to an end. Her beautiful embroidery
had sold for six guineas, and she found herself with the money for more
materials, and three pounds in hand besides, clear profit, towards the
debt. She had also received an order from the dep&ocirc;t for another piece of
work at the same price, which caused her considerable elation, and set
her to work again with a will; and it was only when she could no longer
ply her needle that she allowed herself to take up her pen.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> had no more zest for the ball after
that conversation with Daniel
about the money her mother had given him. She felt obliged to go to it
because he insisted that it was necessary for the wives of professional
men to show themselves on public occasions; but she would not get a new
dress. She had never worn her white silk trimmed with myrtle, and when
she came to look at it again, she decided that it was not so much out of
the fashion after all, and, at any rate, it must do.</p>

<p>When she came down to dinner dressed in it on the night of the ball, she
looked very winsome, and smiled up at Dan in shy expectation of a word
of approval; but none came. In the early days of their acquaintance he
had remarked that she was much more easily depressed than elated about
herself, and would be the better of a little more confidence&mdash;not to say
conceit; but since their marriage he had never given her the slightest
sympathy or encouragement to cure her of her diffidence. If anything
were amiss in her dress or appearance, he told her of it in the
offensive manner of an ill-conditioned under-bred man, generally
speaking when they were out of doors, or in some house where she could
do nothing to put herself right, as if it were some satisfaction to him
to make her feel ill at ease; and if she were complimented by any one
else about anything, he had usually something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
 derogatory to say on the
subject afterwards. Now, when he had inspected her, he sat down to table
without a word.</p>

<p>"Is there anything wrong?" Beth asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "That stuff on your sleeves might have been fresher,
that's all."</p>

<p>"This will be my first ball," Beth ventured, breaking a long silence.</p>

<p>"Well, don't go and tell everybody," he rejoined. "They'll think you
want to make yourself interesting, and it's nothing to boast about. Just
lay yourself out to be agreeable to people who will further your
husband's interests, for once."</p>

<p>"But am I not always agreeable?" Beth exclaimed, much mortified.</p>

<p>"It doesn't appear so," he answered drily. "At any rate, you don't seem
to go down here."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Why, the ladies in the place all seem to shun you, for some reason or
other; not one of them ever comes near you in a friendly way."</p>

<p>"They were all very nice to me the other day at Beg," Beth protested,
her heart sinking at this recurrence of the old reproach; for to be
shunned, or in any way set apart, seemed even more dreadful to her now
than it had done when she was a child.</p>

<p>"See that they keep it up then," he answered grimly.</p>

<p>"If it depends upon me, they will," said Beth, setting her sensitive
mouth in a hard determined line that added ten years to her age and did
not improve her beauty. And it was with a sad heart, and sorely
dissatisfied with herself, that she drove to her first ball.</p>

<p>When they entered the ball-room, however, and Dan beamed about him on
every one in his "thoroughly good fellow" way, her spirits rose. The
decorations, the handsome uniforms, the brilliant dresses and jewels,
the flowers and foliage plants, and, above all, the bright dance-music
and festive faces, delighted her, and she gazed about her with lips just
parted in a little smile, wondering to find it all so gay.</p>

<p>A young military man was brought up to her and introduced by one of the
stewards before she had been five minutes in the room. He asked for the
pleasure of a dance; but, alas! thanks to the scheme of education at the
Royal Service School for Officers' Daughters having been designed by the
authorities to fit the girls for the next world only, Beth could not
dance. She had had some lessons at Miss Blackburne's, but not enough to
give her confidence, so she was obliged to decline. Another and another
would-be partner, and some quite important people, as Dan said, offered,
but in vain; and he looked furious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," he exclaimed, "this is nice for me!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry," Beth answered nervously. She was beginning to have a
painful conviction that a man had to depend almost entirely on his wife
for his success in life, and the responsibility made her quail.</p>

<p>"I shall have to go and do <i>my</i> duty, at any rate," he proceeded. "I
must leave you alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said Beth. "Mrs. Kilroy and Mrs. Orton Beg have just come in;
I will go and join them." She naturally expected Dan to escort her, and
he probably would have done so had he waited to hear what she was
saying; but his marital manners were such that he had taken himself off
while she was speaking, and left her to fend for herself. She was too
glad, however, to see her charming new acquaintances, who had been so
kindly, to care much, and she crossed the room to them, smiling
confidently. As she approached, she saw that they recognised her and
said something to each other. When she came close, they both bowed
coldly, and turned their heads in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Beth stopped short and her heart stood still. The slight was
unmistakable; but what had she done? She looked about her as if for an
explanation, and saw Lady Beg close beside her, talking to Mrs. Carne.</p>

<p>"Ah, how do you do? Nice ball, isn't it?" Lady Beg observed, but without
shaking hands.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Mrs. Carne, and then they resumed their
conversation, taking no further notice of Beth, who would probably have
turned and fled from the dreadful place incontinently, if Mrs. Petterick
had not come up at that moment and spoken to her as one human being to
another, seizing upon Beth as Beth might have seized upon her, in
despair; for Mrs. Petterick had also been having her share of snubs. Oh,
those Christians! how they do love one another! how tender they are to
one another's feelings! how careful to make the best of one another! how
gentle, good, and kind, and true! How singular it is that when the
wicked unbeliever comes to live amongst them, and sees them as they are,
he is not immediately moved by admiration to adopt their religion in
order that he also may acquire the noble attributes so conspicuously
displayed by them!</p>

<p>"You're not dancing, my dear," Mrs. Petterick said. "Come along and sit
with me on that couch against the wall yonder. We shall see all that's
going on from there."</p>

<p>Beth was only too thankful to go. A waltz was being played, and Dan
passed them, dancing with Bertha Petterick. They glided over the floor
together with the gentle voluptuous swing, dreamy eyes, and smiling lips
of two perfect dancers, conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
 of nothing but the sensuous delight
of interwoven paces and clasping arms.</p>

<p>"My! but they do step well together, him and Bertha!" Mrs. Petterick
exclaimed. "He's a handsome man, your husband, and a gay one&mdash;flirting
about with all the ladies! I wonder you're not jealous!"</p>

<p>"Jealous!" Beth answered, smiling. "Not I, indeed! Jealousy is a want of
faith in one's self."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, if you always looked as well as you do just now, you
need not want confidence in yourself," Mrs. Petterick observed. "But
what would you do if your husband gave you cause for jealousy?"</p>

<p>"Despise him," Beth answered promptly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Petterick looked as if she could make nothing of this answer. Then
she became uneasy. The music had stopped, but Bertha had not returned to
her. "I must go and look after my daughter," she said, rising from her
comfortable seat with a sigh. "Gels are a nuisance. You've got to keep
your eye on them all the time, or you never know what they're up to."</p>

<p>Beth stayed where she was, and soon began to feel uncomfortable. People
stared coldly at her as they passed, and she could not help fancying
herself the subject of unpleasant remark because she was alone. She
prayed hard that some one would come and speak to her. Dan had
disappeared. After a time she recognised Sir George Galbraith among the
groups of people at the opposite side of the room. He was receiving that
attention from every one which is so generously conferred on a man or
woman of consequence, whose acquaintance adds to people's own
importance, and to whom it is therefore well to be seen speaking; but
although his manner was courteously attentive he looked round as if
anxious to make his escape, and finally, to Beth's intense relief, he
recognised her, and, leaving the group about him unceremoniously, came
across the room to speak to her.</p>

<p>"Would it be fair to ask you to sit out a dance with me?" he said. "I do
not dance."</p>

<p>"I would rather sit out a dance with you than dance it with any one else
I know here," she answered na&iuml;vely; "but, as it happens, I do not dance
either."</p>

<p>"Indeed! How is that? I should have thought you would like dancing."</p>

<p>"So I should, I am sure, if I could," she replied. "But I can't dance at
all. They would not let me learn dancing at one school where I was, and
I was not long enough at the other to learn properly."</p>

<p>"Now, that is a pity," he said, considering Beth, his professional eye
having been struck by her thinness and languor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> "But have some lessons.
Dancing in moderation is capital exercise, and it exhilarates; and
anything that exhilarates increases one's vitality. Why don't you make
your husband teach you? He seems to know all about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," Beth answered, smiling; "but I shouldn't think teaching me is at
all in his line. Why don't you dance yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am far too clumsy," he said good-naturedly. "My wife says if I
could even learn to move about a room without getting in the way and
upsetting things, it would be something."</p>

<p>"Is she here to-night?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"No, she was not feeling up to it," he answered. "She tired herself in
the garden this afternoon, helping me to bud roses."</p>

<p>"Oh, can you bud roses?" Beth exclaimed. "I should so like to know how
it is done."</p>

<p>"I'll show you with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Will you really?" said Beth. "How kind of you."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Let me see, when will you be at home? We mustn't lose any
time, or it will be too late in the year."</p>

<p>"I'm pretty nearly always at home," Beth said.</p>

<p>"Then if I came to-morrow morning would that be convenient?"</p>

<p>"Quite; and I hope you will stay lunch," Beth answered.</p>

<p>Dan returned to the ball-room just then, and, on seeing who was with
her, he immediately joined them; but Sir George only stayed long enough
to exchange greetings politely.</p>

<p>"You seem to get on very well with Galbraith," Dan observed.</p>

<p>"Don't you like him?" Beth asked in surprise, detecting a note of enmity
in his voice.</p>

<p>"I haven't had much chance," he said bitterly. "He doesn't play the
agreeable to me as he does to you."</p>

<p>Beth missed the drift of this remark in considering the expression "play
the agreeable," which was unpleasantly suggestive to her of under-bred
gentility.</p>

<p>"You will be able to give him an opportunity to-morrow then," she said,
"if you are in at lunch-time, for he is coming to show me how to bud
roses, and I have asked him to stay."</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed?" Dan exclaimed, obviously displeased, but why or
wherefore Beth could not conceive. "I hope to goodness there's something
to eat in the house," he added upon reflection, fussily.</p>

<p>"There is as much as there always is," Beth placidly rejoined.</p>

<p>"Well, that's not enough then. Just think what a man like that has on
his own table!"</p>

<p>"A man like that won't expect our table to be like his."</p>

<p>"You'd better make it appear so for once then, or you'll be having our
hospitality criticised as I heard the Barrack fellows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span> criticise Mrs.
Jeffery's the other day. A couple of them called about lunch-time, and
she asked them to stay, and they said there was nothing but beer and
sherry, and the fragments of a previous feast, and they were blessed if
they'd go near the old trout again."</p>

<p>"An elegant expression!" said Beth. "It gives the measure of the mind it
comes from. Please don't introduce the person who uses it to me. But as
to Sir George Galbraith, you need not be afraid that <i>he</i> will accept
hospitality and criticise it in that spirit. He will neither grumble at
a cutlet, nor describe his hostess by a vulgar epithet after eating it."</p>

<p>She shut her mouth hard after speaking. Disillusion is a great
enlightener; our insight is never so clear as when it is turned on the
character of a person in whom we used to believe; and as Dan gradually
revealed himself to Beth, trait by trait, a kind of distaste seized upon
her, a want of respect, which found involuntary expression in trenchant
comments upon his observations and in smart retorts. She did not seek
sympathy from him now for the way in which she had been slighted at the
ball, knowing perfectly well that he was more likely to blame her than
anybody else. He had, in fact, by this time, so far as any confidence
she might have reposed in him was concerned, dropped out of her life
completely, and left her as friendless and as much alone as she would
have been with the veriest stranger.</p>

<p>That night when she went home she felt world-worn and weary, but next
morning, out in the garden with Sir George Galbraith budding roses, she
became young again. Before they had been together half-an-hour she was
chatting to him with girlish confidence, telling him about her attempts
to cultivate her mind, her reading and writing, to all of which he
listened without any of that condescension in his manner which Dan
displayed when perchance he was in a good-humour and Beth had ventured
to expand. Sir George was genuinely interested.</p>

<p>Dan came in punctually to lunch, for a wonder. He glanced at Beth's
animated face sharply when he entered, but took no further notice of
her. He was one of those husbands who have two manners, a coarse one for
their families, and another, much more polished, which they assume when
it is politic to be refined. But Dan's best behaviour sat ill upon him,
because it was lacking in sincerity, and Beth suffered all through lunch
because of the obsequious pose he thought it proper to assume towards
his distinguished guest.</p>

<p>After lunch, when Sir George had gone, he took up his favourite position
before the mirror over the chimney-piece, and stood there for a little,
looking at himself and caressing his moustache.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>"You talk a great deal too much, Beth," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," he assured her. "Of course Galbraith had to be polite and
affect to listen, but I could see that he was bored by your chatter. He
naturally wanted to talk to me about things that interest men."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth didn't he talk to you?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"How could he when you monopolised the conversation?"</p>

<p>"It was he who kept me talking," she protested.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I notice you are very animated when anything in the shape of a
man comes in," Dan sneered.</p>

<p>Beth got up and left the room, less affected by the insinuation,
however, than by the vulgar expression of it.</p>

<p>The following week Sir George came in one morning with some cuttings,
and stayed a while in the garden with Beth, showing her how to set them;
but he would not wait for lunch. Dan showed considerable annoyance when
he heard of the visit.</p>

<p>"He should come when I am at home," he said. "It is damned bad taste his
coming when you are alone."</p>

<p>The next time Sir George came Dan happened to be in, to Beth's relief.
She had brought her writing down that day, and was working at it on the
dining-room table, not expecting Dan till much later. He was in a genial
mood, for a wonder.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you scribbling about there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just something I was thinking about," Beth answered evasively.</p>

<p>"Going in for authorship, eh?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Beth.</p>

<p>Dan laughed. "You are not at all ambitious," he remarked; then added
patronisingly, "A little of that kind of thing will do you no harm, of
course; but, my dear child, your head wouldn't contain a book, and if
you were just a little cleverer you would know that yourself."</p>

<p>Beth bit the end of her pencil and looked at him dispassionately, and it
was at this moment that Sir George Galbraith was announced.</p>

<p>Dan received him with effusion as usual; and also, as usual, Sir George
responded with all conventional politeness, but the greeting over, he
turned his attention to Beth. He had brought her a packet of books.</p>

<p>"This looks like work in earnest," he said, glancing at the table. "I
see you have a good deal of something done. Is it nearly finished?"</p>

<p>"All but," Beth rejoined.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth looked at him, and then at her manuscript vaguely. "I don't know,"
she said. "What can I do with it?"</p>

<p>"Publish it, if it is good," he answered.</p>

<p>"But how am I to know?" Beth asked eagerly. "Do you think it possible I
could do anything fit to publish?"</p>

<p>Before he could reply, Dan chimed in. "I've just been telling her," he
said, "that little heads like hers can't contain books. It's all very
well to scribble a little for pastime, and all that, but she mustn't
seriously imagine she can do that sort of work. She'll only do herself
harm. Literature is men's work."</p>

<p>"Yet how many women have written, and written well, too," Beth observed.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course&mdash;exceptional women."</p>

<p>"And why mayn't I be an exceptional woman?" Beth asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Coarse and masculine!" Dan exclaimed. "No, thank you. We don't want you
to be one of that kind&mdash;do we, Galbraith?"</p>

<p>"There is not the slightest fear," Sir George answered dryly. "Besides,
I don't think any class of women workers&mdash;not even the pit-brow
women&mdash;are necessarily coarse and masculine. And I differ from you, too,
with regard to that head," he added, fixing his keen, kindly eyes
deliberately on Beth's cranium till she laughed to cover her
embarrassment, and put up both hands to feel it. "I should say there was
good promise both of sense and capacity in the size and balance of
it&mdash;not to mention anything else."</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to know if anybody does," said Dan with a facetious
sort of affectation of agreement, which left no doubt of his
insincerity.</p>

<p>"I wish," Sir George continued, addressing Beth, "you would let me show
some of your work to a lady, a friend of mine, whose opinion is well
worth having."</p>

<p>"I would rather have yours," Beth jerked out.</p>

<p>"Oh, mine is no good," he rejoined. "But if you will let me read what
you give me to show my lady, I should be greatly interested. We were
talking about style in prose the other day, and I have ventured to bring
you these books&mdash;some of our own stylists, and some modern Frenchmen.
You read French, I know."</p>

<p>"There is nothing like the French," Dan chimed in. "We have no
literature at all now. Look at their work compared to ours, how short,
crisp, and incisive it is! How true to life! A Frenchman will give you
more real life in a hundred pages than our men do in all their
interminable volumes."</p>

<p>"More sexuality, you mean, I suppose," said Galbraith,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> "Personally I
find them monotonous, and barren of happy phrases to enrich the mind, of
noble sentiments to expand the heart, of great thoughts to help the
soul; without balance, with little of the redeeming side of life, and
less aspiration towards it. If France is to be judged by the tendency of
its literature and art at present, one would suppose it to be dominated
and doomed to destruction by a gang of lascivious authors and artists
who are sapping the manhood of the country and degrading the womanhood
by idealising self-indulgence and mean intrigue. The man or woman who
lives low, or even thinks low, in that sense of the word, will tend
always to descend still lower in times of trial. Moral probity is the
backbone of our courage; without it we have nothing to support us when a
call is made upon our strength."
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a> The truth of this assertion was lately proved in a terrible
manner at the burning of the Charity Bazaar in the Rue Jean Goujon, when
the nerves of the luxurious gentlemen present, debilitated by close
intimacy with the <i>haute cocotterie</i> in and out of society, betrayed
them, and they displayed the white feather of vice by fighting their own
way out, not only leaving the ladies to their fate, but actually beating
them back with their sticks and trampling on them in their frantic
efforts to save themselves, as many a bruised white arm or shoulder
afterwards testified. There was scarcely a man burnt on the occasion,
husbands, lovers, and fathers escaped, leaving all the heroic deeds to
be done by some few devoted men-servants, some workmen who happened to
be passing, a stray Englishman or American, and mothers who perished in
attempting to rescue their children.</p></div>

<p>"I can't stand English authors myself," was Dan's reply. "They're so
devilish long-winded, don't you know."</p>

<p>"Poverty of mind accounts for the shortness of the book as a rule," said
Galbraith. "I like a long book myself when it is rich in thought. The
characters become companions then, and I miss them when we are forced to
part."</p>

<p>Beth nodded assent to this. She had been turning over the books that
Galbraith had brought her, with the tender touch of a true book-lover
and that evident interest and pleasure which goes far beyond thanks.
Mere formal thanks she forgot to express, but she had brightened up in
the most wonderful way since Galbraith appeared, and was all smiles when
he took his leave.</p>

<p>Not so Dan, however; but Beth was too absorbed in the books to notice
that.</p>

<p>"How kind he is!" she exclaimed. "Dan, won't it be delightful if I
really can write? I might make a career for myself."</p>

<p>"Rot!" said Dan.</p>

<p>"Sir George differs from you," Beth rejoined.</p>

<p>"I say that's all rot. What does he know about it? I tell you you're a
silly fool, and your head wouldn't contain a book. I ought to know!"</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<p>"Doctors differ again, then, it seems," Beth said. "But in this case
the patient is going to decide for herself. What is the use of opinion
in such matters? One must experiment. I'm going to write, and if at
first I don't succeed&mdash;I shall persevere."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course!" Dan sneered. "You'll take anybody's advice but your
husband's. However, go your own way, as I know you will. Only, I warn
you, you'll regret it."</p>

<p>Beth was dipping into one of the books, and took no notice of this.
Dan's ill-humour augmented.</p>

<p>"Did you know the fellow was coming to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;if by fellow you mean Sir George Galbraith," she answered casually,
still intent on the book.</p>

<p>"You know well enough who I mean, and that's just a nag," he retorted.
"And it looks uncommonly as if you did expect him, and had set all that
rubbish of writing out to make a display."</p>

<p>Beth bit the end of her pencil, and looked at Dan contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I dare say he'd like to get hold of you to make a tool of you," he
pursued. "He's in with Lord Dawne and the whole of that advanced woman's
party at Morne, who are always interfering with everything."</p>

<p>"How?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"By poking their noses into things that don't concern them," he
asseverated, "things they wouldn't know anything about if they weren't
damned nasty-minded. There's that fanatical Lady Fulda Guthrie, and Mrs.
Orton Beg, and Mrs. Kilroy, besides Madam Ideala&mdash;they're all
busybodies, and if they succeed in what they're at just now, by Jove,
they'll ruin me! I'll have my revenge, though, if they do! I'll attack
your distinguished friend. He has established himself as a humanitarian,
and travels on that reputation; but he has an hospital of his own, where
I have no doubt some pretty games are played in the way of experiments
which the public don't suspect. <i>I</i> know the kind of thing! Patients
mustn't ask questions! The good doctor will do his best for them&mdash;trust
him! He'll try nothing that he doesn't know to be for their good; and
when they're under chloroform he'll take no unfair advantage in the way
of cutting a little more for his own private information than they've
consented to. Oh, I know! Galbraith seems to be by way of slighting me,
but I'll show him up if it comes to that&mdash;and, at any rate, I'm on the
way to discoveries myself, and I bet I'll teach him some things in his
profession yet that will make him sit up&mdash;things he doesn't suspect,
clever and all as he is."</p>

<p>Beth knew nothing of the things to which Dan alluded, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> therefore
missed the drift of this tirade; but the whole tone of it was so
offensive to her that she gathered up her books and papers and left the
room. Silence and flight were her weapons of defence in those days.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a gap of six months between that last visit of Sir George
Galbraith's and the next, and in the interval Beth had worked hard,
reading and re-reading the books he had lent her, writing, and perhaps
most important of all, reflecting, as she sat in her secret chamber,
busy with the beautiful embroideries which were to pay off that dreadful
debt. She had made seven pounds by this time, and Aunt Grace Mary had
sent her five for a present surreptitiously, advising her to keep it
herself and say nothing about it&mdash;Aunt Grace Mary knew what husbands
were. Beth smiled as she read the letter. She, too, was beginning to
know what husbands are&mdash;husbands of the Uncle James kind. She added the
five pounds to her secret hoard, and thanked goodness that the sum was
mounting up, little by little.</p>

<p>But she wished Sir George would return. He was a busy man, and lived at
the other side of the county, so that she could not expect him to come
to Slane on her account; but surely something more important would bring
him eventually, and then she might hope to see him. She knew he would
not desert her. And she had some manuscript ready to confide to him now
if he should repeat his offer; but she was too diffident to send it to
him except at his special request.</p>

<p>She was all energy now that the possibility of making a career for
herself had been presented to her, but it was the quietly restrained
energy of a strong nature. She never supposed that she could practise a
profession without learning it, and she was prepared to serve a long
apprenticeship to letters if necessary. She meant to write and write and
write until she acquired power of expression. About what she should have
to express she never troubled herself. It was the need to express what
was in her that had set her to work. She would never have to sit at a
writing-table with a pen in her hand waiting for ideas to come. She had
discovered by accident that she could have books in plenty, and of the
kind she required, from the Free Library at Slane. Dan never troubled
himself to consult her taste in books, but he was in the habit of
bringing home three-volume novels for himself from the library, a form
of literature he greatly enjoyed in spite of his strictures. He made
Beth read them aloud to him in the evening, one after the other&mdash;an
endless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
 succession&mdash;while he smoked, and drank whiskies-and-sodas. He
brought them home himself at first, but soon found it a trouble to go
for them, and so sent her; and then it was she discovered that there
were other books in the library. The librarian, an educated and
intelligent man, helped her often in the choice of books. They had long
talks together, during which he made many suggestions, and gave Beth
many a hint and piece of information that was of value to her. He was
her only congenial friend in Slane, and her long conversations with him
often took her out of herself and raised her spirits. He little
suspected what a help he was to the lonely little soul. For the most
part she took less interest in the books themselves than in the people
who wrote them; biographies, autobiographies, and any scrap of anecdote
about authors and their methods she eagerly devoured. Life as they had
lived it, not as they had observed and imagined it, seemed all-important
to her; and as she read and thought, sitting alone in the charmed
solitude of her secret chamber, her self-respect grew. Her mind, which
had run riot, fancy-fed with languorous dreams in the days when it was
unoccupied and undisciplined, came steadily more and more under control,
and grew gradually stronger as she exercised it. She ceased to rage and
worry about her domestic difficulties, ceased to expect her husband to
add to her happiness in any way, ceased to sorrow for the slights and
neglects that had so wounded and perplexed her during the first year of
her life in Slane; and learnt by degrees to possess her soul in
dignified silence so long as silence was best, feeling in herself <i>that</i>
something which should bring her up out of all this and set her apart
eventually in another sphere, among the elect&mdash;feeling this through her
further faculty to her comfort, although unable as yet to give it any
sort of definite expression. As she read of those who had gone before,
she felt a strange kindred with them; she entered into their sorrows,
understood their difficulties, was uplifted by their aspirations, and
gloried in their successes. Their greatness never disheartened her; on
the contrary, she was at home with them in all their experiences, and at
her ease as she never was with the petty people about her. It delighted
her when she found in them some small trait or habit which she herself
had already developed or contracted, such as she found in the early part
of George Sand's <i>Histoire de ma Vie</i>, and in the lives of the Bront&euml;s.
Under the influence of nourishing books, her mind, sustained and
stimulated, became nervously active. It had a trick of flashing off from
the subject she was studying to something wholly irrelevant. She would
begin Emerson's essay on <i>Fate</i> or <i>Beauty</i> with enthusiasm, and
presently, with her eyes still following the lines, her thoughts would
be busy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
 forming a code of literary principles for herself. In those
days her mind was continually under the influence of any author she
cared about, particularly if his style were mannered. Involuntarily,
while she was reading Macaulay, for instance, her own thoughts took a
dogmatic turn, and jerked along in short, sharp sentences. She caught
the peculiarities of De Quincey too, of Carlyle, and also some of the
simple dignity of Ruskin, which was not so easy; and she had written
things after the manner of each of these authors before she perceived
the effect they were having upon her. But it was unfortunate for her
that her attention had been turned from the matter which she had to
express to the manner in which she should express it. From the time she
began to think of the style and diction of prose as something to be
separately acquired, the spontaneous flow of her thoughts was checked
and hampered, and she expended herself in fashioning her tools, as it
were, instead of using her tools to fashion her work. When, in her
reading, she came under the influence of academic minds, she lost all
natural freshness, and succeeded in being artificial. Her English became
turgid with Latinities. She took phrases which had flowed from her pen,
and were telling in their simple eloquence, and toiled at them, turning
and twisting them until she had laboured all the life out of them; and
then, mistaking effort for power, and having wearied herself, she was
satisfied. Being too diffident to suspect that she had any natural
faculty, she conceived that the more trouble she gave herself the better
must be the result; and consequently she did nothing worth the doing
except as an exercise of ingenuity. She was serving her apprenticeship,
however&mdash;making her mistakes.</p>

<p>It was late in the autumn before she saw her good friend Sir George
Galbraith again. He came on a bright, clear, frosty morning, and found
her out in the garden, pacing up and down briskly, and looking greatly
exhilarated by the freshness. When she saw him coming towards her, she
uttered a little joyful exclamation, and hurried forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"I have been longing to see you," she said in her unaffected way; "but I
know what the distance is, and how fully your time is occupied. It is
very good of you to come at all."</p>

<p>"Only the time and distance have prevented me coming sooner," he
rejoined. "But, tell me, how have you been getting on? And have you
thought any more of making a career for yourself?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of nothing else," Beth answered brightly; "and I wonder
I ever thought of anything else, for the idea has been in me, I believe,
all my life. I must have discussed it, too, at a very early age, for I
have remembered lately that I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
 once advised by an old aunt of mine,
the best and dearest friend I ever had, to write only that which is&mdash;or
aims at being&mdash;soul-sustaining."</p>

<p>He nodded his head approvingly. "From such seed a good crop should
come," he said. "But what line shall you take?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Not novels then, for certain?"</p>

<p>"Nothing for certain&mdash;whatever comes and calls for expression."</p>

<p>They were pacing up and down together, and there was a pause.</p>

<p>"Did you expect I should try to write novels, and do you think I ought?"
Beth asked at last.</p>

<p>"I think I did expect it," he answered; "but as to whether you ought or
ought not, that is for you to decide. There is much to be said against
novel reading and writing. I think it was De Quincey who said that
novels are the opium of the West; and I have myself observed that
novel-reading is one of those bad habits that grow upon people until
they are enslaved by it, demoralised by it; and if that is the case with
the reader, what must the writer suffer?"</p>

<p>Beth bent her brows upon this. "But that is only one side of it, is it
not?" she asked after a moment's reflection. "I notice in all things a
curious duality, a right side and a wrong side. Confusion is the wrong
side of order, misery of happiness, falsehood of truth, evil of good;
and it seems to me that novel-reading, which can be a vice, I know, may
also be made a virtue. It depends on the writer."</p>

<p>"And on the taste of the reader," he suggested. "But I believe the taste
of the intelligent 'general reader' is much better than one supposes.
The mind craves for nourishment; and the extraordinary success of books
in which any attempt, however imperfect, is made to provide food for
thought, as distinguished from those which merely offer matter to
distract the attention, bears witness, it seems to me, to the
involuntary effort which is always in progress to procure it. I believe
myself that good fiction may do more to improve the mind, enlarge the
sympathies, and develop the judgment than any other form of
literature&mdash;partly because it looks into the hidden springs of action,
and makes all that is obscure in the way of impulse and motive clear to
us. Biography, for instance, merely skims the surface of life, as a
rule; and in history, where man is a puppet moved by events, there can
be very little human nature."</p>

<p>"I wonder if you read many novels," said Beth. "I have to read them
aloud to my husband until I am satiated. And I am determined, if I ever
do try to write one, to avoid all that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
 conventional. I never will
have a faultlessly beautiful heroine, for instance. I am sick of that
creature. When I come to her, especially if she has golden hair yards
long, a faultless complexion, and eyes of extraordinary dimensions, I
feel inclined to groan and shut the book. I have met her so often in the
weary ways of fiction! I know every variety of her so well! She consists
of nothing but superlatives, and is as conventional as the torso of an
Egyptian statue, with her everlasting physical perfection. I think her
as repulsive as a barber's block. I confess that a woman who has golden
hair and manages to look like a lady, or to be like one even in a book,
is a wonder, considering all that is associated with golden hair in our
day; but I should avoid the abnormal as much as the conventional. I
would not write plotty-plotty books either, nor make a pivot of the
everlasting love-story, which seems to me to show such a want of balance
in an author, such an absence of any true sense of proportion, as if
there was nothing else of interest in life but our sexual relations.
But, oh!" she broke off, "how I do appreciate what the difficulty of
selection must be! In writing a life, if one could present all sides of
it, and not merely one phase&mdash;the good and the bad of it, the joys and
the sorrows, the moments of strength and of weakness, of wisdom and of
folly, of misery and of pure delight&mdash;what a picture!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and how utterly beyond the average reader, who never understands
complexity," he answered. "But I think it a good sign for your chances
of success that you should have complained of the difficulty of
selection in the matter of material rather than bemoan your want of
experience of life. Most young aspirants to literary fame grumble that
they are handicapped for want of experience. They are seldom content
with the material they have at hand&mdash;the life they know. They want to go
and live in London, where they seem to think that every one worth
knowing is to be found."</p>

<p>"That isn't my feeling at all," said Beth. "The best people may be met
in London, but I don't believe that they are at their best. The friction
of the crowd rubs out their individuality. In a crowd I feel mentally as
if I were in a maze of telegraph wires. The thoughts of so many people
streaming out in all directions about me entangle and bewilder me."</p>

<p>"You do not seem to like anything exceptional."</p>

<p>"No, I do not," said Beth. "I like the normal&mdash;the everyday. Great
events are not the most significant, nor are great people the most
typical. It is the little things that make life livable. The person who
comes and talks clever is not the person we love, nor the person who
interests us most. Those we love sympathise with us in the ordinary
everyday incidents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
 our lives, and discuss them with us, merely
touching, if at all, on the thoughts they engender. I don't want to know
what people think as a rule; I want to know what they have experienced.
People who talk facts, I like; people who talk theories, I fly from. And
I think upon the whole that I shall always like the kind people better
than the clever ones. I believe we owe more to them, too, and learn more
from them&mdash;more human nature, which after all is what we want to know."</p>

<p>"But the clever people are kind also sometimes," said Sir George.</p>

<p>"When they are, of course it is perfect," Beth answered. "But judging
the clever ones of to-day by what they write, I cannot often think them
so. The works of our smartest modern writers, particularly the French,
satiate me with their cleverness; but they are vain, hollow, cynical,
dyspeptic; they appeal to the head, but the heart goes empty away. Few
of them know or show the one thing needful&mdash;that happiness is the end of
life; and that by trying to live rightly we help each other to
happiness. That is the one thing well worth understanding in this world;
but that, with all their ingenuity, they are not intelligent enough to
see."</p>

<p>"You are an optimist, I perceive," Sir George said, smiling, "and I
entirely agree with you. So long as we understand that happiness is the
end of life, and that the best way to secure it for ourselves is by
helping others to attain to it, we are travelling in the right
direction. By happiness I do not mean excitement, of course, nor the
pleasure we owe to others altogether; but that quiet content in
ourselves, that large toleration and love which should overflow from us
continually, and make the fact of our existence a source of joy and
strength to all who know us."</p>

<p>They walked up and down a little in silence, then Sir George asked her
what she thought of some of the specimens of style and art in literature
he had lent her to study.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Beth said. "My mind is in a state of chaos on the
subject. I seem to reject 'style' and 'art.' I ask for something more or
something else, and am never satisfied. But tell me what you think of
the stylists."</p>

<p>"I think them brilliant," he rejoined, "but their work is as the
photograph is to the painting, the lifeless accuracy of the machine to
the nervous fascinating faultiness of the human hand. No, I don't care
for the writers who are specially praised for their style. I find their
productions cold and bald as a rule. I want something warmer&mdash;more
full-blooded. Most of the stylists write as if they began by acquiring a
style and then had to sit and wait for a subject. I believe style is the
enemy of matter. You compress all the blood out of your subject when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
you make it conform to a studied style, instead of letting your style
form itself out of the necessity for expression. This is rank heresy, I
know, and I should not have ventured on it a few years ago; but now, I
say, give me a style that is the natural outcome of your subject, your
mind, your character, not an artificial but a natural product; and even
though it be as full of faults as human nature is, faults of every kind,
so long as there is no fault of the heart in it, that being the one
unpardonable fault in an author&mdash;if you have put your own individuality
into your work&mdash;I'll answer for it that you will arrive sooner and be
read longer than the most admired stylist of the day. Be prepared to
sacrifice form to accuracy, to avoid the brilliant and the marvellous
for the simple and direct. What matters it how the effect is got so that
it comes honestly? But of course it will be said that this, that, and
the other person did not get their effects so; they will compare you to
the greatest to humiliate you."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be nothing to me so that I produced my own effects,"
Beth broke in. "That is just where I am at present. I mean to be myself.
But please do not think that I have too much assurance. If I go wrong, I
hope I shall find it out in time; and I shall certainly be the first to
acknowledge it. I do not want to prove myself right; I want to arrive at
the truth."</p>

<p>"Then you will arrive," he assured her. "But above everything, mind that
you are not misled by the cant of art if you have anything special to
say. If a writer would be of use in his day, and not merely an amuser of
the multitude, he must learn that right thinking, right feeling, and
knowledge are more important than art. When you address the blockhead
majority, you must not only give them your text, you must tell them also
what to think of it, otherwise there will be fine misinterpretation. You
may be sure of the heart of the multitude if you can touch it; but its
head, in the present state of its development, is an imperfect machine,
man&oelig;uvred for the most part by foolishness. People can see life for
themselves, but they cannot always see the meaning of it, the why and
wherefore, whence things come and whither they are tending, so that the
lessons of life are lost&mdash;or would be but for the efforts of the modern
novelist."</p>

<p>Beth reflected a little, then she said: "I am glad you think me an
optimist. It seems to me that healthy human nature revolts from
pessimism. The work that lasts is the work that cheers. Give us
something with hope in it&mdash;something that appeals to the best part of
us&mdash;something which, while we read, puts us in touch with fine ideals,
and makes us feel better than we are."</p>

<p>"That is it precisely," said he. "The school of art-and-style
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> books
wearies us because there is no aspiration in it, nothing but a deadly
dull artistic presentment of hopeless levels of life. It is all cold
polish, as I said before, with never a word to warm the heart or stir
the better nature."</p>

<p>"That is what I have felt," said Beth; "and I would rather have written
a simple story, full of the faults of my youth and ignorance, but with
some one passage in it that would put heart and hope into some one
person, than all that brilliant barren stuff. And I'm going to write for
women, not for men. I don't care about amusing men. Let them see to
their own amusements, they think of nothing else. Men entertain each
other with intellectual ingenuities and Art and Style, while women are
busy with the great problems of life, and are striving might and main to
make it beautiful."</p>

<p>"Now that is young in the opprobrious sense of the word," said Sir
George. "It is only when we are extremely young that we indulge in such
sweeping generalisations."</p>

<p>Beth blushed. "I am always afraid my judgment will be warped by my own
narrow personal experience,&mdash;I must guard against that!" she exclaimed,
conscious that she had had her husband in her mind when she spoke.</p>

<p>Sir George nodded his head approvingly, and looked at his watch. "I must
go," he said, "but I hope there will not be such a long interval before
I come again. My wife is sorry that she has not been able to call. She
is not equal to such a long drive. But she desired me to explain and
apologise; and she has sent you some flowers and fruit which she begs
you will accept. Have you some of your work ready for me this time? I
have asked my friend Ideala to give you her opinion, which is really
worth having, and she says she will with pleasure. You must know her. I
am sure you would like her extremely."</p>

<p>"But would she like me?" slipped from Beth unawares.</p>

<p>"Now, that is young again," he said, with his kindly smile-indulgent.</p>

<p>"It is the outcome of sad experience," Beth rejoined with a sigh. "No
woman I have met here so far has shown any inclination to cultivate my
acquaintance. I think I am being punished for some unknown crime."</p>

<p>Sir George became thoughtful, but said nothing.</p>

<p>As they approached the house, Beth saw Dan peeping at them from behind
the curtain of an upstairs window. The hall-table was covered with the
fruit and flowers Sir George had brought. Beth sent a servant for Dan.
The girl came back and said that the doctor was not in.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Beth. "I saw him at one of the windows just now. If you
will excuse me, Sir George, I will find him myself."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p>She called him as she ran upstairs, and Dan made his appearance, looking
none too well pleased.</p>

<p>He went down to Sir George, and Beth ran on up to her secret chamber for
her manuscripts and the books Sir George had lent her, which had been
waiting ready packed for many a day.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>When he had gone, Beth danced round the dining-room, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"I can't contain myself," she exclaimed. "I do feel encouraged,
strengthened, uplifted."</p>

<p>She caught a glimpse of Dan's face, and stopped short.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she said.</p>

<p>"The matter is that I'll have no more of this," he answered in a brutal
tone.</p>

<p>"No more of what?" Beth demanded.</p>

<p>"No more of this man's philandering after you," he retorted.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," Beth gasped.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're mighty innocent," he sneered. "You'll be telling me next
that he comes to see <i>me</i>, lends <i>me</i> books, walks up and down by the
hour together with <i>me</i>, brings <i>me</i> fruit and flowers! You think I'm
blind, I suppose! <i>You</i>'re a nice person! and so particular too! and so
fastidious in your conversation! Oh, trust a prude! But I tell you," he
bawled, coming up close to her, and shaking his fist in her face, "I
tell you I won't have it. Now, do you understand that?"</p>

<p>Beth did not wince, but oh, what a drop it was from the heights she had
just left to this low level! "Be good enough to explain your meaning
precisely," she said quietly. "I understand that you are bringing some
accusation against me. It is no use blustering and shaking your fist in
my face. I am not to be frightened. Just explain yourself. And I advise
you to weigh your words, for you shall answer to me in public for any
insult you may offer me in private."</p>

<p>Dr. Maclure was sobered by this unexpected flash of spirit. They had
been married nearly three years by this time, and Beth's habitual
docility had deceived him. Hitherto men have been able to insult their
wives in private with impunity when so minded, and Dan was staggered for
a moment to find himself face to face with a mere girl who boldly
refused to suffer the indignity. He was not prepared for such a display
of self-respect.</p>

<p>"You're very high and mighty!" he jeered at last.</p>

<p>"I am very determined," Beth rejoined, and set her lips.</p>

<p>He tried to subdue her by staring her out of countenance; but Beth
scornfully returned his gaze. Then suddenly she stamped her foot, and
brought her clenched fist down on the dining-room table, beside which
she was standing. "Come,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
 come, sir," she said, "we've had enough of
this theatrical posing. You are wasting my time, explain yourself."</p>

<p>He took a turn up and down the room.</p>

<p>"Look here, Beth," he began, lowering his tone, "you cannot pretend that
Galbraith comes to see me."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't right that he should come to see you, and I won't have
it," he reiterated.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I am not to have any friends of my own?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> is not to be one of your friends," Dan answered doggedly.</p>

<p>"And what explanation am I to give him, please?" she asked politely.</p>

<p>"I won't have you giving him any explanation."</p>

<p>"My dear Dan," she rejoined, "when you speak in that way, you show an
utter want of knowledge of my character. If I will not allow you to
insult me, and bully me, and bluster at me, it is not likely that I will
allow you to insult my friends. If Sir George Galbraith's visits are to
stop, I shall tell him the reason exactly. He at least is a gentleman."</p>

<p>"That is as much as to say that I am not," Dan blustered.</p>

<p>"You certainly are not behaving like one now," Beth coolly rejoined.
"But there! You have my ultimatum. I am not going to waste any more time
in vulgar scenes with you."</p>

<p>"Ultimatum, indeed!" he jeered. "Well, you <i>are</i>, you know! You'll write
and explain to him, will you, that your husband's jealous of him? That
shows the terms you are on!"</p>

<p>"It is jealousy then, is it?" said Beth. "Thank you. Now I understand
you."</p>

<p>Dan's evil mood took another turn. His anger changed to self-pity. "Oh
dear! oh dear! what am I to do with you?" he exclaimed. "And after all
I've done for you&mdash;to treat me like this." He took out his
pocket-handkerchief and wiped away the tears which any mention of his
own goodness and the treatment he received from others always brought to
his eyes.</p>

<p>Beth watched him contemptuously, yet her heart smote her. He was a poor
creature, but for that very reason, and because she was strong, surely
she should be gentle with him.</p>

<p>"Look here, Dan," she said. "I have never knowingly done you any wrong
in thought, or word, or deed; all you have said to me to-day has been
ridiculously wrong-headed; but never mind. Stop crying, do, and don't
let us have any more idiotic jealousy. Why, it was Lady Galbraith who
sent me the flowers and fruit, with a kind message of apology because
she has not been able to call. Why should not she be jealous?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, she's a fool!" Dan rejoined, recovering himself. "She leads him the
life of a dog with her fears and fancies, and she won't take any part in
his philanthropic work, though he wishes it. She's a pretty pill!"</p>

<p>The servant came in at this moment to lay the table for lunch, and Dan
went to the looking-glass with the inconsequence of a child, and forgot
his grievance in the contemplation of his own beloved image and in
abusing Lady Galbraith. Abusing somebody was mental relaxation of the
most agreeable kind to him. Feeling that he had gone too far, he was
gracious to Beth during lunch, and just before he went out he kissed
her, and said, "We won't mention that fellow again, Beth. I don't
believe you'd do anything dishonourable."</p>

<p>"I should think not!" said Beth.</p>

<p>When he had gone, she returned to her secret chamber, the one little
corner sacred to herself, to her purest, noblest thoughts, her highest
aspirations; and as she looked round, it seemed as if ages had passed
since she last entered it, full of happiness and hope. It was as if she
had been innocent then, and was now corrupted. Her self-control did not
give way, but she could do nothing, and just sat there, wan with horror;
and as she sat, every now and then she shivered from head to foot. She
had known of course in a general way that such things did happen, that
married women did give their husbands cause for jealousy; but to her
mind they were a kind of married women who lived in another sphere where
she was not likely to encounter them. She had never expected to be
brought near such an enormity, let alone to have it brought home to
herself in a horrible accusation; and the effect of it was a shock to
her nervous system&mdash;one of those stunning blows which are scarcely felt
at first, but are agonising in their after effects. When the reaction
set in, Beth's disgust was so great it took a physical form, and ended
by making her violently sick. It was days before she quite recovered,
and in one sense of the word she was never the same again.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dan</span> said no more about Sir George Galbraith; and indeed he had no
excuse, for Sir George did not come again. There were other men,
however, who came to the house, Dan's own friends; and now that Beth's
eyes were opened, she perceived that he watched them all suspiciously if
they paid her any attention; and if she showed the slightest pleasure in
the conversation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
 any of them, he would be sure to make some sneering
remark about it afterwards. Dan was so radically vicious that the notion
of any one being virtuous except under compulsion was incomprehensible
to him.</p>

<p>"Your spirits seem to go up when Mr. Vanrickards is here," he observed
one day.</p>

<p>"Thank you for warning me," Beth answered, descending to his level in
spite of herself. "I will be properly depressed the next time he comes."</p>

<p>But although she could keep him in check so that he dared not say all
that he had in his mind, she understood him; and the worst of it was
that his coarse and brutal jealousy accustomed her to the suspicion, and
made her contemplate the possibility of such a lapse as he had in his
mind. She began to believe that he would not have tormented himself so
if husbands did not ordinarily have good reason to be jealous of their
wives. She concluded that such treachery of man to man as he dreaded
must be normal. And then also she realised that it was thought possible
for a married woman to fall in love, and even wondered at last if that
would ever be her own case. Dan had, in fact, destroyed his own best
safeguard. If a man would keep his wife from evil, he should not teach
her to suspect herself&mdash;neither should he familiarise her with ideas of
vice. Since their marriage Dan's whole conversation, and the depravity
of his tastes and habits, had tended towards the brutalisation of Beth.
Married life for her was one long initiation into the ways of the
vicious.</p>

<p>Dr. Maclure's sordid jealousy made him the laughing-stock of the place,
though he never suspected it. His conceit was too great to let him
suppose that any sentiment of his could provoke ridicule. It became
matter for common gossip, however, and from that time forward gentlemen
ceased to visit the house. Men of a certain kind came still, men who
were bound to Dan by kindred tastes, but not such as he cared to
introduce to Beth. These boon companions generally came in the evening,
and were entertained in the dining-room, where they spent the night
together, smoking, drinking, and talking after the manner of their kind.
Beth could not use her secret chamber after dark for fear of the light
being seen, so she stayed in the drawing-room alone till she went to
bed. She found those evenings interminable, and the nights more trying
still. She could not read or write because of the noise in the
dining-room, and had to fall back on her sewing for occupation; but
sewing left her mind open to any obsession, and only too often, with the
gross laughter from the next room, scraps of the lewd topics her husband
delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
 in came to her recollection. When Dan discoursed about such
things he was at the high-water mark of pleasure, his countenance
glowed, and enjoyment of the subject was expressed in all his person.
Beth's better nature revolted, but alas! she had become so familiar with
such subjects by this time that, although she loathed them, she could
not banish them. Life from her husband's point of view was a torment to
her, yet under the pressure of his immediate influence it was forced
upon her attention more and more&mdash;from his point of view.</p>

<p>When she went to bed on his festive nights she suffered from the dread
of being disturbed. If her husband were called out at night
professionally, it was a pleasure to her to lie awake so that she might
be ready to rise the moment he returned, and get him anything he wanted.
On those occasions she always had a tray ready for him, with soup to be
heated, or coffee to be made over a spirit-lamp, and any little dainty
she thought would refresh him. She was fully in sympathy with him in his
work, and would have spared herself no fatigue to make it easier for
him, but she despised him for his vices, and refused to sacrifice
herself in order to make them pleasanter for him. When he stayed up
smoking and drinking half the night she resented the loss of sleep
entailed upon her, which meant less energy for her own work the next
day. The dread of being disturbed made her restless, and the futility of
it under the circumstances exasperated her. She suffered, too, more than
can be mentioned, from the smell of alcohol and tobacco, of which he
reeked, and from which he took no trouble to purify himself. Often and
often, when she had tossed herself into a fever on these dreadful
nights, she craved for long hours, with infinite yearning, to be safe
from disturbance, in purity and peace; and thought how happily, how
serenely she would have slept until the morning, and how strong and
fresh she would have arisen for another day's work had she been left
alone. Only once, however, did she complain. Dan was going out in a
particularly cheerful mood that night.</p>

<p>"Shall you be late?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, probably. Why?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking, if you wouldn't mind, I would have a bed made up for
you in the spare room. <i>I</i> only sleep in snatches when you are out and I
am expecting you. Every sound rouses me. I think it is the door opening.
And then when you do come it disturbs me, and I do not sleep again. If
you don't mind I should prefer to be alone&mdash;on your late nights&mdash;your
late festive nights."</p>

<p>Dr. Maclure stood looking gloomily into the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Have I annoyed you, Dan?" Beth asked at last.</p>

<p>He walked to the door, stood a moment with his back to her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> then turned
and looked at her. "Annoyed is not the word," he said. "You have wounded
me deeply."</p>

<p>He opened the door as he spoke, and went out. When he had gone Beth sat
and suffered. She could not bear to hurt him, she was not yet
sufficiently brutalised for that; so she said no more on the subject,
but patiently endured the long lonely night watches, and the after
companionship which had in it all that is most trying and offensive to a
refined and delicate woman.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>After that first display of jealousy Beth discovered that her husband
pried upon her continually. He was very high and mighty on the subject
of women spying upon men, but there seemed no meanness he would not
compass in order to spy upon a woman. He had duplicate keys to her
drawers and boxes, and rummaged through all her possessions when she
went out. One day she came upon him standing before her wardrobe,
feeling in the pockets of her dresses, and on another occasion she
discovered him unawares in her bedroom, picking little scraps of paper
out of the slop-pail and piecing them together to see what she had been
writing. To Beth, accustomed to the simple, honourable principles of her
parents, and to the confidence with which her mother had left her
letters lying about, because she knew that not one of her children would
dream of looking at them, Dan's turpitude was revolting. On those
occasions when she caught him, he did not hear her enter the room, and
she made her escape without disturbing him, and stole up to her secret
chamber, and sat there, suffering from one of those attacks of nausea
and shivering which came upon her in moments of deep disgust.</p>

<p>After that she had an attack of illness which kept her in bed for a
week; but even then, feverish and suffering as she was, and yearning for
the coolness and liberty of a room to herself, she dared not suggest
such a thing for fear of a scene.</p>

<p>While she was still in bed Dan brought her some letters one morning. He
made no remark when he gave them to her, but he had opened them as
usual, and stood watching her curiously while she read them. The first
she looked at was from her sister Bernadine, and had a black border
round it; but she took it out of its envelope unsuspiciously, and read
the words that were uppermost, "<i>Mamma died this morning</i>." In a moment
it flashed upon her that Dan had read the letter, and was waiting now to
see the effect of the shock upon her. She immediately, but
involuntarily, set herself to baffle his cruel curiosity. With a calm,
illegible face she read the letter from beginning to end, folded it, and
put it back in its envelope deliberately, then took up another which had
also been opened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>But suppressed feeling finds vent in some form or other, and Beth showed
temper now instead of showing grief. "I wish you would not open my
letters," she said irritably. "All the freshness of them is gone for me
when you open them without my permission and read them first. Besides,
it is an insult to my correspondents. What they say to me is intended
for me, and not for you."</p>

<p>"I have a perfect right to open your letters," he retorted.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the Scripture that gives you the right, and I
should advise you to waive it if you do not wish me to assume the right
to open yours. Your petty prying keeps me in a continual state of
irritation. I shall be lowered to retaliate sooner or later. So stop it,
please, once and for all."</p>

<p>"My petty prying, indeed!" he exclaimed. "Well, that is a nice thing to
say to your husband! Why, even when I do open your letters, which is not
often, I never read them without your permission."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Beth, who had ceased to be stunned by falsehoods. "Then
be good enough not even to open them in future."</p>

<p>Dan tried to express injury and indignation in a long, hard look; but
Beth was reading another letter, and took no further notice of him.</p>

<p>He hung about a little watching her.</p>

<p>"Any news," he ventured at last, with an imperfect assumption of
indifference.</p>

<p>"You know quite well what my news is," she answered bluntly, "and I am
not going to discuss it with you. I wish you would leave me alone."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a nice pill!" said Dan, discomfited.</p>

<p>Beth looked up at him. "What are you doing with your hat on in my
bedroom?" she asked sharply. "I thought I had made you understand that
you must treat me with respect, even if I am your wife."</p>

<p>Dan uttered a coarse oath, and left the room, banging the door after
him.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven&mdash;at last!" Beth ejaculated. She had been too anxious to
get rid of him to scruple about the means, but when he had gone a
reaction set in, and she lay back on her pillows, flushed, excited,
furious with him, disgusted with herself. She felt she was falling away
from all her ideals. "As the husband is the wife is"&mdash;the words flashed
through her mind, but she would not believe it inevitable. But even if
she should degenerate, her own nature was too large, too strong, too
generous to cast the blame on any one but herself. "No!" she exclaimed.
"We are what we allow ourselves to be."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>Swift following upon that thought came the recollection of a bad fall
she had had when she was a little child in Ireland, and the way her
mother had picked her up, and cuddled her, and comforted her. Beth burst
into a paroxysm of tears. She had understood her mother better than her
mother had understood her, had felt for her privations, had admired and
imitated her patient endurance; and now to think that it was too late,
to think that she had gone, and it would never be in Beth's power to
brighten her life or lessen the hardship of it! That was all she thought
of. Every week since her marriage she had sent her mother a long,
cheerful, amusing letter, full of pleasant details&mdash;an exercise in that
form of composition; but with never a hint of her troubles; and Mrs.
Caldwell died under the happy delusion that it was well with Beth. She
never suspected that she had married Beth to a low-born man&mdash;not
low-born in the sense of being a tradesman's son, for a tradesman's son
may be an honest and upright gentleman, just as a peer's son may be a
cheat and a snob; but low-born in that he came of parents who were
capable of fraud and deceit in social relations, and had taught him no
scheme of life in which honour played a conspicuous part. Beth had done
her best for her mother, but there was no one now to remind her of this
for her comfort, poor miserable girl. Her courageous toil had gone for
nothing&mdash;her mother would never even know of it; and it seemed to her in
that moment of deep disheartenment as if everything she tried was to be
equally ineffectual.</p>

<p>Hours later, Minna the housemaid found Beth sitting up in bed, sobbing
hopelessly; and got her tea, and stayed with her, making her put some
restraint upon herself by the mere fact of her presence; and presently
Beth, in her human way, began to talk about her mother to the girl,
which relieved her. Mrs. Caldwell had only been ill a few days, and not
seriously, as it was supposed; the end had come quite suddenly, so that
Beth had never been warned.</p>

<p>Dan did not come in till next morning, which was a great relief to her.
She meant to speak about the news to him when he appeared, but somehow,
the moment she saw him, her heart hardened, and she could not bring
herself to utter a word on the subject. The position was awkward for
him; but he got out of it adroitly by pretending he had seen an
announcement of the death in the paper.</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to go to the funeral," he said. "There is doubtless a
will."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," said Beth, "but you will not benefit by it, if that is what
you are thinking of. Mamma considered that I was provided for, and
therefore she left the little she had to Bernadine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span> She told me
herself, because she wanted me to understand her reason for making such
a difference between us; and I think she was quite right. She may have
left me two or three hundred pounds, but it will not be more than that."</p>

<p>"But even that will be something towards the bills," said Dan, his
countenance, which had dropped considerably, clearing again.</p>

<p>Beth looked at him with a set countenance, but said no more. She had
begun to observe that the bills only became pressing when her allowance
was due.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> one in Slane gave Sir George Galbraith a hint of Dan's coarse
jealousy, and he had judged it better for Beth that he should not call
again; but his interest in her and his desire to help her increased if
anything. He had read her manuscript carefully himself, and obtained
Ideala's opinion of it also; but Beth had not done her best by any means
in the one she had given him. She had written it for the purpose, for
one thing, which was fatal, for her style had stiffened with anxiety to
do her best, and her ideas, instead of flowing spontaneously, had been
forced and formal, as her manner was when she was shy. It is one thing
to have a fine theory of art and high principles (and an excellent
thing, too), but it is quite another to put them into effect, especially
when you're in a hurry to arrive. Hurry misplaced is hindrance. If Beth
had given Sir George some one of the little things which she had written
in sheer exuberance of thought and feeling, without hampering hopes of
doing anything with them, he would have been very differently impressed;
but, even as it was, what she had given him was as full of promise as it
was full of faults, and he was convinced that he had not been mistaken
in her, especially when he found that Ideala thought even better of her
prospects than he did. Ideala, who was an impulsive and generous woman,
wrote warmly on the subject, and Sir George sent her letter to Beth with
a few lines of kindly expressed encouragement from himself. He returned
her manuscript; but when Beth saw it again, she was greatly
dissatisfied. The faults her friends had pointed out to her she plainly
perceived, and more also; but she could not see the merits. Praise only
made her the more fastidious about her work; but in that way it helped
her.</p>

<p>Sir George's kindness did not stop at criticism however. He was cut off
from her himself, and could expect no help from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> wife, whose nervous
system had suffered so much from the shock of unhappy circumstances in
her youth that she could not now bear even to hear of, let alone to be
brought in contact with, any form of sorrow or suffering; but there were
other ladies&mdash;Mrs. Kilroy of Ilverthorpe, for instance. Sir George had
known her all her life, and went specially to ask her as a favour to
countenance Beth.</p>

<p>"I want you to be kind to Mrs. Maclure, Angelica," he said. "She's far
too good for that plausible bounder of a barber's block she's married."</p>

<p>"Then why did she marry him?" Angelica interrupted, in her vivacious
way.</p>

<p>"Pitchforked into it at the suggestion of her friends in her infancy, I
should say, reasoning by induction," he answered. "That's generally the
explanation in these cases. But, at any rate, she's not going to be
happy with him. And she's a charming little creature, very sweet and
docile naturally, and with unusual ability, or I'm much mistaken, and
plenty of spirit, too, when she's roused, I should anticipate. But at
present, in her childish ignorance, she's yielding where she should
resist, and she'll be brutalised if no one comes to the rescue. I don't
trust that man Maclure. A man who speaks flippantly of things that
should be respected is not a man who will be scrupulous when his own
interests are concerned; and such a man has it in his power to make the
life of a girl a hell upon earth in ways which she will not complain of,
if she has no knowledge to use in self-defence; and girls seldom have."</p>

<p>"As I have learnt, alas! from bitter experience in my work amongst the
victims of holy matrimony," Angelica interposed bitterly. "Oh, how
sickening it all is! Sometimes I envy Evadne in that she is able to
refuse to know."</p>

<p>Sir George was silent for a little, then he said, "This is likely to be
a more than usually pathetic case, because of the girl's unusual
character and promise, and also because her brain is too delicately
poised to stand the kind of shocks and jars that threaten her. You will
take pity on her, Angelica?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kilroy shrugged her shoulders. "How can I countenance a woman who
acquiesces in such a position as her husband holds, and actually lives
on his degrading work?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe she knows anything about it," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"If I were sure of that," said Angelica, meditating.</p>

<p>"It is easy enough to make sure," he suggested.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Mrs. Carne, wife of the leading medical man in Slane, conceived it to be
her duty to patronise Beth to the extent of an occasional formal call,
as she was the wife of a junior practitioner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> and Beth duly returned
these calls, because she was determined not to make enemies for Dan by
showing any resentment for the slights she had suffered in Slane.</p>

<p>Feeling depressed indoors one dreary afternoon, she set off, alone as
usual, to pay one of these visits. She rather hoped perhaps to find some
sort of satisfaction by way of reward for the brave discharge of an
uncongenial duty.</p>

<p>On the way into town, Dan passed her in his dogcart with a casual nod,
bespattering her with mud. "You'll have your carriage soon, please God!
and never have to walk. I hate to see a delicate woman on foot in the
mud." Beth remembered the words so well, and Dan's pious intonation as
he uttered them, and she laughed. She had a special little laugh for
exhibitions of this kind of divergence between Dan's precepts and his
practices. But even as she laughed her face contracted as with a sudden
spasm of pain, and she ejaculated&mdash;"But I shall succeed!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carne was at home, and Beth was shown into the drawing-room, where
she found several other lady visitors&mdash;Mrs. Kilroy, Mrs. Orton Beg, Lady
Fulda Guthrie, and Ideala. The last two she had not met before.</p>

<p>"Where will you sit?" said Mrs. Carne, who was an effusive little
person. "What a day! You were brave to come out, though perhaps it will
do you good. My husband says go out in all weathers and battle with the
breeze; there's nothing like exercise."</p>

<p>"Battling with the breeze and an umbrella on a wet day is not exercise,
it is exasperation," Beth answered, and at the sound of her peculiarly
low, clear, cultivated voice, the conversation stopped suddenly, and
every one in the room looked at her. She seemed unaware of the
attention. In fact, she ignored every one present except her hostess.
This was her habitual manner now, assumed to save herself from slights.
When she entered, Mrs. Kilroy had half risen from her seat, and
endeavoured to attract her attention; but Beth passed her by,
deliberately chose a seat, and sat down. Her demeanour, so apparently
cold and self-contained, was calculated to command respect, but it cost
Beth a great deal to maintain it. She felt she was alone in an
unfriendly atmosphere&mdash;a poor little thing, shabbily dressed in
home-made mourning, and despised for she knew not what offence; and she
suffered horribly. She had grown very fragile by this time, and looked
almost childishly young. Her eyes were unnaturally large and wistful,
her mouth drooped at the corners, and the whole expression of her face
was pathetic. Mrs. Kilroy looked at her seriously, and thought to
herself, "That girl is suffering."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Carne offered Beth tea, but she refused it. She could not accept
such inhuman hospitality. She had come to do her duty, not to force a
welcome. She glanced at the clock. Five minutes more, and she might go.
The conversation buzzed on about her. She was sitting next to a strange
lady, a serene and dignified woman, dressed in black velvet and sable.
Beth glanced at her the first time with indifference, but looked again
with interest. Mrs. Carne bustled up and spoke to the lady in her
effusive way.</p>

<p>"You are better, I hope," she said, as she handed her some tea. "It
really is <i>sweet</i> to see you looking so <i>much</i> yourself again."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am quite well again now, thanks to your good husband," the
lady answered. "But he has given me so many tonics and things lately, I
always seem to be shaking bottles. I am quite set in that attitude.
Everything I touch I shake. I found myself shaking my watch instead of
winding it up the other day."</p>

<p>"Ah, then, you are quite yourself again, I see," Mrs. Carne said archly.
"But why didn't you come to the Wilmingtons' last night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know I never go to those functions if I can help it," the lady
answered, her gentle rather drawling voice lending a charm to the words
quite apart from their meaning. "I cannot stand the kind of conversation
to which one is reduced on such occasions&mdash;if you can call that
conversation which is but the cackle of geese, each repeating the
utterances of the other. When the Lord loves a woman, I think He takes
her out of society by some means or other, and keeps her out of it for
her good."</p>

<p>Beth knew that if she had said such a thing, Mrs. Carne would have
received it with a stony stare, but now she simpered. "That is so like
you!" she gushed. "But the Wilmingtons were <i>dreadfully</i> disappointed."</p>

<p>"They will get over it," the lady answered, glancing round
indifferently.</p>

<p>"How are you getting on with your new book, Ideala?" Mrs. Kilroy asked
her across the room. Beth instantly froze to attention. This was her
friend, then, Sir George's Ideala.</p>

<p>"I have not got into the swing of it yet," Ideala answered. "It is all
dot-and-go-one&mdash;a uniform ruggedness which is not true either to life or
mind. Our ways in the world are stony enough at times, but they are not
all stones. There are smooth stretches along which we gallop, and
sheltered grassy spaces where we rest."</p>

<p>"What <i>I</i> love about <i>your</i> work is the <i>style</i>," said Mrs. Carne.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you?" Ideala rejoined, somewhat dryly as it seemed to Beth. "But
what is style?"</p>

<p>"I am so bad at definitions," said Mrs. Carne, "but I <i>feel</i> it, you
know."</p>

<p>"As if it were a thing in itself to be adopted or acquired?" Ideala
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so," said Mrs. Carne in a tone of relief&mdash;as of one who has
acquitted herself better than she expected and is satisfied.</p>

<p>"I am sure it is not," Beth burst out, forgetting herself and her
slights all at once in the interest of the subject. "I have been reading
the lives of authors lately, together with their works, and it seems to
me, in the case of all who had genius, that their style was the outcome
of their characters&mdash;their principles&mdash;the view they took of the
subject&mdash;that is, if they were natural and powerful writers. Only the
second-rate people have a manufactured style, and force their subject to
adapt itself to it&mdash;the kind of people whose style is mentioned quite
apart from their matter. In the great ones the style is the outcome of
the subject. Each emotion has its own form of expression. The language
of passion is intense; of pleasure jocund, easy, abundant; of content
calm, of happiness strong but restrained; of love warm, tender. The
language of artificial feeling is artificial; there is no mistaking
insincerity when a writer is not sincere, and the language of true
feeling is equally unmistakable. It is simple, easy, unaffected; and it
is the same in all ages. The artificial styles of yesterday go out of
fashion with the dresses their authors wear, and become an offence to
our taste; but Shakespeare's periods appeal to every generation. He
wrote from the heart as well as the head, and triumphed in the grace of
nature."</p>

<p>Beth stopped short and coloured crimson, finding that every one in the
room was listening to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carne stood while she was speaking with a cup of tea in her hand,
and tried to catch Ideala's eye in order to signal with raised eyebrows
her contempt for Beth's opinion; but Ideala was listening with approval.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I think," she exclaimed, "only I could not have
expressed it so. You write yourself doubtless?"</p>

<p>But Beth had become confused, and only gazed at her by way of reply. She
felt she had done the wrong thing to speak out like that in such
surroundings, and she regretted every word, and burned with vexation.
Then suddenly in herself, as before, something seemed to say, or rather
to flash forth the exclamation for her comfort: "I shall succeed! I
shall succeed!"</p>

<p>She drew herself up and looked round on them all with a look that
transformed her. Such an assurance in herself was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> not to be doubted.
The day would come when they would be glad enough to see her, when she
too would be heard with respect and quoted. She, the least considered,
she in her shabby gloves, neglected, slighted, despised, alone, she
would arrive, would have done something&mdash;more than them all!</p>

<p>She arose with her eyes fixed on futurity, and was half-way home before
she came to and found herself tearing along through the rain with her
head forward and her hands clasped across her chest, urged to energy by
the cry in her heart, "I shall succeed! I shall succeed!"</p>

<p>"Who was that?" said Ideala in a startled voice when Beth jumped up and
left the room.</p>

<p>"The wife of that Dr. Maclure, you know," Mrs. Carne replied. "Her
manners seem somewhat abrupt. She forgot to say good-bye. I did not know
she was by way of being clever."</p>

<p>"By way of being clever!" Ideala ejaculated. "I wish I had known who she
was. Why didn't you introduce her? By way of being clever, indeed! Why,
she is just what I have missed being with all my cleverness, or I am
much mistaken, and that is a genius. And what is more important to us, I
suspect she is the genius for whom we are waiting. Why, <i>why</i> didn't you
name her? It is the old story. She came unto her own, and her own
received her not."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never dreamt you would care to know her&mdash;her position, you know,"
Mrs. Carne stammered disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Her position! What is her position to me?" Ideala exclaimed. "It is the
girl herself I think of. Besides, I daresay she doesn't even know what
her position is!"</p>

<p>"That is what Sir George says, and he knows her well," Mrs. Kilroy
interposed.</p>

<p>"But I never suspected that she was in the least interesting," Mrs.
Carne protested; "and I'm sure she doesn't look attractive&mdash;such an
expression!"</p>

<p>"You are to blame for that, all of you," Ideala rejoined, with something
in her gentle way of speaking which had the effect of strength and
vehemence. "I know how it has been. She is sensitive, and you have made
her feel there is something wrong. You have treated her so that she
expects no kindness from you, and so, from diffidence and restraint of
tenderness, her face has set hard into coldness. But that is only a
mask. How you treat each other, you women! And you are as wanting in
discernment, too, as you are in kindness and sympathy. She has had to
put on that mask of coldness to hide what you make her suffer, and it
will take long loving to melt it now, and make her look human again. You
misinterpret her silence too. How can you expect her to be interesting
if you take no interest in her?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
 But look at her eyes? Any one with the
least kindly discernment might have seen the love and living interest
there! If she had been in a good position, everybody would have found
her as singularly interesting as she, without caring a rap for our
position, has found us. She sees through us all with those eyes of
hers&mdash;ay, and beyond! She sees what we have never seen, and never shall
in this incarnation; hers are the vision and the dream that are denied
to us. Were she to come forward as a leader to-morrow, I would follow
her humbly and do as she told me.... I read some of her writings the
other day, but I thought they were the work of a mature woman. Had I
known she was such a child I should have wondered!"</p>

<p>"Dear me! does she really write?" said Mrs. Carne. "Well, you surprise
me! I should never have dreamt that she had anything in her!"</p>

<p>"You make me feel ashamed of myself, Ideala," said Mrs. Kilroy with
contrition. "I ought to have known. But I could think of nothing, see
nothing in her but that horrible business. I shall certainly do my best
now, however, when we return from town, to cultivate her acquaintance,
if she will let me."</p>

<p>"Let you!" Mrs. Carne ejaculated with her insinuating smile. "I should
think she would be flattered."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," said Ideala.</p>

<p>"Neither am I," said Mrs. Kilroy. "I only wish I were. But she ignored
us all rather pointedly when she came in."</p>

<p>"To save herself from being ignored, I suppose," said Ideala bitterly.
"The girl is self-respecting."</p>

<p>"I confess I liked her the first time I saw her," said Mrs. Orton Beg;
"but afterwards, when I heard what her husband was, I felt forced to
ignore her. How can you countenance her if she approves?"</p>

<p>"It was a mistake to take her approval for granted," said Mrs. Kilroy.
"Ideala would have inquired."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ideala. "I take nothing for granted. If I hear anything
nice, I believe it; but if I hear anything objectionable about any one,
I either inquire about it or refuse to believe it point-blank. And in a
case like this, I should be doubly particular, for, in one of its many
moods, genius is a young child that gazes hard and sees nothing."</p>

<p>"And you really think the little woman is a genius, and will be a great
writer some day?" Mrs. Carne asked with exaggerated deference to
Ideala's opinion.</p>

<p>"I don't know about being a writer," said Ideala. "Genius is versatile.
There are many ways in which she might succeed. It depends on
herself&mdash;on the way she is finally impelled to choose. But great she
will be in something&mdash;if she lives."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us hope that she will be a great benefactor of her own sex then,
and do great good," said the gentle Lady Fulda.</p>

<p>"Amen!" Ideala ejaculated fervently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carne tried to put off her agreeable society smile and put on her
Sunday-in-church expression, but was not in time. When we only assume an
attitude once a week, be it mental or physical, we do not fall into it
readily on a sudden.</p>

<p>"Not that working for women as a career is what I should wish her for
her own comfort," said Ideala after a pause. "Women who work for women
in the present period of our progress&mdash;I mean the women who bring about
the changes which benefit their sex&mdash;must resign themselves to
martyrdom. Only the martyr spirit will carry them through. Men will
often help and respect them, but other women, especially the workers
with methods of their own, will make their lives a burden to them with
pin-pricks of criticism, and every petty hindrance they can put in their
way. There is little union between women workers, and less tolerance.
Each leader thinks her own idea the only good one, and disapproves of
every other. They seldom see that many must be working in many ways to
complete the work. And as to the bulk of women, those who will benefit
by our devotion, they bespatter us with mud, stone us, slander us,
calumniate us; and even in the very act of taking advantage of the
changes we have brought about, ignore us, slight us, push us under, and
step up on our bodies to secure the benefits which our endeavours have
made it possible for them to enjoy. I know! I have worked for women
these many years, and could I show you my heart, you would find it
covered with scars&mdash;the scars of the wounds with which they reward me."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>When Beth got in that day, she found Dan standing in the hall, examining
a letter addressed to herself. She took it out of his hand without
ceremony, and tore it open. "Hurrah!" she exclaimed, "it's accepted."</p>

<p>"What's accepted?" he asked.</p>

<p>"An article I sent to <i>Sunshine</i>. And the editor says he would like to
see some more of my work," Beth rejoined, almost dancing with delight.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose that will put much in your pocket," Dan observed. "He
wouldn't praise you if he meant to pay you."</p>

<p>"But he has sent me a cheque for thirty shillings," said Beth.</p>

<p>Dan's expression changed. "Then you may be sure it's worth double," he
said. "But you might get some nice notepaper for me out of it, and have
it stamped with my crest, like a good girl. It's necessary in my
profession, and I've finished the last you got."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth laughed as she had laughed&mdash;that same peculiar mirthless little
laugh&mdash;when he drove past her and splashed her with mud on the road. "It
never seems to occur to you that I may have some little wants of my own,
Dan," she said; "you are a perfect horseleech's daughter."</p>

<p>Dan gazed at her blankly. He never seemed to understand any such
allusion. "You've got a grievance, have you?" he snarled. "Do <i>I</i> ever
prevent you getting anything you like?"</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders by way of answer, and went into the
dining-room. He followed her, bent on making a scene; and she,
perceiving this, set herself down on a chair and folded her hands.</p>

<p>He took a turn up and down the room. "And this is my fine marriage into
a county family, which was to have done so much for me!" he ejaculated
at last. "But I might have known better, considering the hole I took you
out of. You've soon forgotten all I've done for you."</p>

<p>Beth smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>"Oh yes! it's a laughing matter," he proceeded. "I've just ruined myself
by marrying you; that's what I've done. Not a soul in the place will
come to the house because of you. Nobody could ever stand you but me;
and what have I got by it? Not a halfpenny! It was just a swindle, the
whole business."</p>

<p>"Be careful!" Beth flashed forth. "If you make such assertions you must
prove them. The day is past when a man might insult his wife with
impunity. I have already told you I won't stand it. It would neither be
good for you nor for me if I did."</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a swindle," he bawled. "Where are the seven or eight hundred a
year I married you for?"</p>

<p>Beth looked at him a moment, then burst out laughing. "Dear Dan," she
said, offering him the cheque, "you shall have the thirty shillings all
to yourself. You deserve it for telling the truth for once. I consider I
have had the best of the bargain, though. Thirty shillings is cheap for
such valuable information."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn you!" said Dan, leaving the room and banging the door after
him.</p>

<p>Beth signed the cheque and left it lying on his writing-table. She never
saw it again.</p>

<p>Then she went up to her secret chamber, and spent long hours&mdash;sobbing,
sobbing, sobbing, as if the marks of her married life on her character
could be washed away with tears.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> had made fifty pounds in eighteen months by her beautiful
embroideries; but after her mother's death she did no more for sale,
neither did she spend the money. She had suffered so many humiliations
for want of money, it made her feel safer to have some by her. She gave
herself up to study at this time, and wrote a great deal. It was winter
now, and she was often driven down from her secret chamber to the
dining-room by the cold. When Dan came in and found her at work, he
would sniff contemptuously or facetiously, according to his mood at the
moment. "Wasting paper as usual, eh? Better be sewing on my buttons,"
was his invariable remark. Not that his buttons were ever off, or that
Beth ever sewed them on either. She was too good an organiser to do
other people's work for them.</p>

<p>She made no reply to Dan's sallies. With him her mind was in a state of
solitary confinement always&mdash;not a good thing for her health, but better
on the whole than any attempt to discuss her ideas with him, or to talk
to him about anything, indeed, but himself.</p>

<p>Beth fared well that winter, however&mdash;fared well in herself, that is.
She had some glorious moments, revelling in the joy of creation. There
is a mental analogy to all physical processes. Fertility in life comes
of love; and in art the fervour of production is also accompanied by a
rapture and preceded by a passion of its own. When Beth was in a good
mood for work, it was like love&mdash;love without the lover; she felt all
the joy of love, with none of the disturbance. When the idea of
publication was first presented to her, it robbed her of this joy. As
she wrote, she thought more of what she might gain than of what she was
doing. Visions of success possessed her, and the ideas upon which her
attention should have been fully concentrated were thinned by
anticipations; and during that period her work was indifferent. Later,
however, she worked again for work's sake, loving it; and then she
advanced. She saw little of Dan in those days, and thought less; but
when they met, she was, as usual, gentle and tolerant, patiently
enduring his "cheeriness," and entering into no quarrel unless he forced
one upon her.</p>

<p>One bright frosty morning he came in rather earlier than usual and found
her writing in the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Well, I've had a rattling good ride this morning," he began, plunging
into his favourite topic as usual without any pretence of interest in
her or in her pursuits. "Nothing like riding for improving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> the
circulation! I wish to goodness I could keep another horse. It would add
to my income in the long run. But I'm so cursedly handicapped by those
bills. They keep me awake at night thinking of them."</p>

<p>Beth sucked the end of her pencil and looked out of the window,
wondering inwardly why he never tried to pay them.</p>

<p>"I calculate that they come to just three hundred pounds," he proceeded,
looking keenly at Beth as he spoke; but she remained unmoved. "Don't you
think," he ventured, "it would be a good thing to expend that three
hundred pounds your mother left you on the debts? I know I could make
money if I once got my head above water."</p>

<p>"That three hundred brings me in fifteen pounds a year," said Beth. "It
is well invested, and I promised my mother not to touch any of my little
capital. There is the interest, however, it arrived this morning. You
can have <i>that</i> if you like."</p>

<p>"Well, that would be a crumb of comfort, at all events," he said,
pouncing on the lawyer's letter, which was lying beside Beth on the
table, and gloating on the cheque. "But don't you think, now that you
have the interest, it would be a good time to sell and get the
principal? Of course your mother was right and wise to advise you not to
part with your capital; but this wouldn't be parting with it, because I
should pay you back in time, you know. It would only be a loan, and I'd
give you the interest on it regularly too; just think what a relief it
would be to me to get those bills paid!" He ran his fingers up through
his hair as he spoke, and gazed at himself in the glass tragically.</p>

<p>"Any news?" said Beth, after a little pause.</p>

<p>Dan, baffled, turned and began to walk up and down the room. "No, there
never is any news in this confounded hole," he answered, venting his
irritation on the place. "Oh, by the way, though, I am forgetting. I was
at the Pettericks' to-day. That girl Bertha is not getting on as I
should like."</p>

<p>"The hysterical one?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes," he answered, hesitating. "The one who threatened to be
hysterical at one time. But that's all gone off. Now she's just weak,
and she should have electricity; but I can't be going there every day to
apply it&mdash;takes too much time: so I suggested to her people that she
should come here for a while, as a paying patient, you know."</p>

<p>"And is she coming?" Beth said, rather in dismay.</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow," he replied. "I said you'd be delighted; but you must
write and say so yourself, just for politeness' sake. It will be a good
thing for you too, you know. You are too much alone, and she'll be a
companion for you. She's not half a bad girl."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I be obliged to give her much of my time?" Beth asked
lugubriously.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no! She'll look after herself," Dr. Maclure cheerfully assured
her. "I'll hire a piano for her. Must launch out a little on these
occasions, you know. It's setting a sprat to catch a whale."</p>

<p>The piano arrived that afternoon. Beth wished Dan had let her choose it;
but a piano of any kind was a delight. She had not had one since her
marriage. Dan had said at first that a piano was a luxury which they
must not think of when they could not afford the necessaries; and a
luxury he had considered it ever since.</p>

<p>Bertha Petterick was not the kind of person that Beth would have chosen
for a companion, and she dreaded her coming; but before Bertha had been
in the house a week she had so enlivened it that Beth wondered she had
ever objected to her. Bertha fawned upon Beth from the first, and was by
way of looking up to her, and admiring her intellect. She was four or
five years older than Beth, but gave herself no airs on that account.
She was a dark girl, good looking in a common kind of way, with a
masculine stride in her walk, a deep mannish voice; and not at all
intellectual, but very practical: what some people consider a fine girl
and others a coarse one, according to their taste. She was a good shot,
could make a dress, cook a dinner, ride to hounds, and play any game;
and she was what is called good-natured, that is to say, ready to do for
any one anything that could be done on the spur of the moment. Things
she might promise to do, or things requiring thought, she did not
trouble herself about; but she would finish a pretty piece of work for
Beth, gather flowers or buy them and do the table decorations, and keep
things tidy in the sitting-rooms. She played and sang well, and was
ready to do both at any time if she were asked, which was a joy to Beth;
and her bright chatter kept Dan in a good humour, which was a relief.
She had plenty of money, and spent it lavishly. Every time she went out
she bought Beth something, a piece of music she had mentioned, a book
she longed for, materials for work, besides flowers and fruit and sweets
in unlimited quantities. Beth remonstrated, but Bertha begged Beth not
to deprive her of the one pleasure she had in life just then, the
pleasure of pleasing Beth, and of acknowledging what she never could
repay but dearly appreciated&mdash;Beth's sisterly sympathy, her consistent
kindness! Such sayings were tinged with sadness, which made Beth suspect
that Bertha had some secret sorrow; but if so, it was most carefully
concealed, for there was not a trace of it in her habitual manner. She
showed no physical delicacy either; but then, as she said herself, she
was picking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
 up in such a wonderful way under the treatment, she really
began to feel that there was very little the matter with her.</p>

<p>Dan managed to be at home a great deal to look after his patient, and
was most attentive to her. He hired a brougham three times a week to do
his rounds in, that she might accompany him, and so get the air without
fatigue or risk of cold; and he would have her to sit with him in the
dining-room when he was smoking, and rolled cigarettes for her; or would
spend the evening with her in the drawing-room, listening to her playing
and singing, or playing bezique with her, and seemingly well content,
although in private he sometimes said to Beth it was all a beastly bore,
but he must go through with it as a duty since he had undertaken it, it
being his way to do a thing thoroughly if he did it at all.</p>

<p>"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might," he added
piously. "If a thing's worth doing at all, it's worth doing well, I
always think."</p>

<p>That was his formula for the time being, but Beth judged him by his
demeanour, which was gay, and not by his professions, and did not pity
him. She was in excellent spirits herself, for her writing was going
well; and it varied the monotony pleasantly for her to have Bertha to
talk to, and walk, play, or sew with, after her work. Bertha's
demonstrations of affection, too, were grateful to Beth, who had had so
little love either bestowed upon her or required of her.</p>

<p>Bertha had been in the house three months, when one day her mother
called, and found Beth alone, Dan and Bertha having gone for a drive
together. Mrs. Petterick had just returned from abroad, where the whole
family had been living most of the time that Bertha had been with the
Maclures.</p>

<p>"Really," Mrs. Petterick said, "I don't know how to thank you for your
kindness to my girl. She's quite a different person I can see by her
letters, thanks to the good doctor. Before he took her in hand she was
quite hysterical, and had to lie down two or three times a day, because
she said she had no strength for anything. But really three months is an
abuse of hospitality; and I think she should be coming home now."</p>

<p>"Oh no, do let her stay a little longer if you can spare her," Beth
pleaded. "It is so nice to have her here."</p>

<p>"Well, it is good of you to say so," said Mrs. Petterick, "but it must
be a great expense to you. We weren't well off ourselves at one time.
Mr. Petterick's a self-made man, and I know that every additional mouth
makes a difference. But, however, you being proud, I won't offend you by
offering money in exchange for kindness, which can't be repaid, but
shan't be forgotten."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Petterick had gone, Beth sat awhile staring into the fire. She
was somewhat stunned, for Dan had assured her that Bertha was a paying
patient, and that, it seemed, had been a gratuitous lie. She was roused
at last by Minna, the parlour-maid. "Please, ma'am, a lady wishes to see
you," Minna said.</p>

<p>"Show her in," Beth answered listlessly. But the next moment she
stiffened with astonishment, for the lady who entered was Mrs. Kilroy of
Ilverthorpe.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have taken you by surprise," Mrs. Kilroy began rather
nervously.</p>

<p>"Will you sit down?" Beth said coldly. "You cannot wonder if I am
surprised to see you. This is the first visit you have paid me, although
we met directly after I came to Slane some years ago. You were kind and
cordial on that occasion, but the next time I saw you&mdash;at that ball&mdash;you
slighted me; and after that you shunned me until I met you the other day
at Mrs. Carne's, and then you seemed inclined to take me up again. I do
not understand such caprices, and I do not like them."</p>

<p>"It was not caprice," Mrs. Kilroy assured her. "I liked you very much
the first time we met, and I should have called immediately; but when I
asked for your address, I was told that your husband was in charge of
the Lock Hospital&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, the hospital for the diseases of women," Beth said. "But what
difference does that make?"</p>

<p>"It made me jump to the hasty conclusion that you approved of the
degradation of your own sex," said Angelica.</p>

<p>"The degradation of my own sex!" said Beth bewildered. "What is a Lock
Hospital?"</p>

<p>Angelica explained the whole horrible apparatus for the special
degradation of women.</p>

<p>"Now perhaps you will understand what we felt about you," Angelica
concluded&mdash;"we who are loyal to our own sex, and have a sense of
justice&mdash;when we thought you were content to live on the means your
husband makes in such a shameful way."</p>

<p>An extraordinary look of relief came into Beth's face. "Then it was not
my fault&mdash;not because I was horrid," she exclaimed. All the slights were
as nothing the moment she gathered that she had not deserved them.
Angelica stared at her. But it was not in Beth's nature to think long
about herself; only the full force of what she had just heard as it
concerned others did not come to her for some seconds. When it did, she
was overcome. "How could you suppose that I knew?" she gasped at last.
"This is the first hint I have had of the loathsome business. My husband
talks to me about&mdash;many things that he had better not have
mentioned&mdash;but about this he has never said a word."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then he must have suspected that you would disapprove," said Mrs.
Kilroy.</p>

<p>"Disapprove!" Beth ejaculated. "The whole thing makes me sick. I ought
to have been told before I married him. I never would have spoken to a
man in such a position had I known. You did well to avoid me."</p>

<p>"No," said Angelica. "I did ill, and I feel humiliated for my own want
of penetration&mdash;for my hasty conclusion. It was Sir George Galbraith who
first made me suspect that you knew nothing about it, and I would have
come at once to make sure, but we were just leaving the neighbourhood,
and we only returned yesterday. Ideala did not believe that you knew it
either, and she rated us all for the way we had treated you. She has
been in America ever since she met you at Mrs. Carne's, but she is
coming home next week, and has written to entreat me to ask you to meet
her. Will you? Will you come and stay with me? Do! and talk this over
with us. I can see that it has been a great shock to you."</p>

<p>"I cannot answer you now," said Beth, "I must think&mdash;I must think what I
had better do."</p>

<p>"Yes, think it over," said Angelica, "then write and tell me when you
will come. Only do come. You will find yourself among friends&mdash;congenial
friends, I venture to prophesy."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Kilroy had gone, Beth went to her bedroom, and waited there
for Dan. It was the only place where she could be sure of seeing him
alone. He dressed for dinner now that Miss Petterick was with them.</p>

<p>Dan came in whistling hilariously. He stopped short when he saw Beth's
face.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kilroy has been here."</p>

<p>"I hope you thanked her for nothing!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I forgot to thank her at all," Beth said, "although she has
put me under an obligation to her."</p>

<p>"May I ask what the obligation is?"</p>

<p>"She told me frankly why no decent woman will associate with us. It is
not my fault after all, it seems, but yours&mdash;you and your Lock Hospital.
It is against the Anglo-Saxon spirit to admit panders into society."</p>

<p>"Oh, she told you about that, did she, the meddling busybody!" he
answered coolly. "I was afraid they would, some of them, damn them! and
I knew you would go into hysterics. She didn't tell you the necessity
for it, I suppose, nor the good it is doing; but I will; so just listen
to me, then you'll see perhaps that I know more about it than these
canting sentimentalists."</p>

<p>Beth, sitting in judgment on him, set her mouth and listened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> in silence
until he stopped. In his own defence he gave her many revolting details
couched in the coarsest language.</p>

<p>"But then, in the name of justice," she exclaimed, "what means do you
take to protect those poor unfortunate women from disease? What do you
do to the men who spread it? What becomes of diseased men?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they marry, I suppose. Anyhow, that is not my business. Doctors
can't be expected to preach morals. Sanitation is our business."</p>

<p>"But aren't morals closely connected with sanitation?" Beth said. "And
why, if sanitation is your business, do you take no radical measures
with regard to this horrible disease? Why do you not have it reported,
never mind who gets it, as scarlet fever, smallpox, and other
diseases&mdash;all less disastrous to the general health of the
community&mdash;are reported?"</p>

<p>Dan shrugged his shoulders. "It's a deuced awkward thing for a man to be
suspected of disease. It's a stigma, and might spoil his prospects.
Women are so cursedly prying nowadays. They've got wind of its being
incurable, and many a one won't marry a man if a suspicion of it
attaches to him."</p>

<p>"I see," said Beth. "The principles of the medical profession with
regard to sanitation when women are in question seem to be peculiar. I
wish to Heaven I had known them sooner." She hid her face in her hands,
and suddenly burst into tears.</p>

<p>Dan scowled. "Well, this is nice!" he exclaimed. "I have had a devilish
hard day's work, and come in cheery, as usual, to do my best to make
things pleasant for you, and this is the reception I get! You're a nice
pill, indeed!" He went off muttering into his dressing-room and slammed
the door.</p>

<p>When he appeared in the drawing-room, he found Beth and Bertha chatting
together as usual, and as, during the rest of the evening, he could
detect no difference in Beth's manner, he congratulated himself that she
was going to accept the position as inevitable, and say no more about
it. It was not Beth's way to return to a disagreeable subject once it
had been discussed, unless she meant to do something in the matter, and
Dan conceived that there was nothing to be done in this instance. He
considered that he was not the sort of man it was safe for women to
interfere with, and he guessed she knew it!</p>

<p>He was mistaken, however, when he supposed that she had let the subject
drop, and was going to resign herself to an invidious position. She was
merely letting it lapse until she understood it. It was all as new to
her as it was horrifying, and she required time to study both sides of
the question. Her own sense of justice was too acute to let her accept
at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
 once the accusation that so-called civilised men, who boast of their
chivalrous protection of the "weaker sex," had imposed upon women a
special public degradation, while the most abandoned and culpable of
their own sex were not only allowed to go unpunished, but to spread vice
and disease where they listed. The iniquitous injustice and cruelty of
it all made her sick and sorry for men, and reluctant to believe it.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>A few days after Mrs. Kilroy's visit, Mrs. Carne called on Beth. Mrs.
Carne always followed the county people. To her they were a sacred set.
Her faith in all they did was touching and sincere. The stupidest remark
of the stupidest county lady impressed her more than the most brilliant
wit of a professional man's wife. When she stayed at a country-house,
whatever the tone of it, she felt like a shriven saint, so uplifted was
she by reverence for rank. On finding, therefore, that some of the most
influential ladies in the county were diffidently anxious to win Beth
into their set, rather than prepared to admit her with confident
patronage, as Mrs. Carne would have expected, it was natural that she
should revise her own opinion of Beth, and also seek to cultivate her
acquaintance.</p>

<p>She called in the morning by way of being friendly; but Beth, who was
hard at work at the time, did not feel grateful for the attention. Minna
showed Mrs. Carne straight into the dining-room, where Beth usually
worked now that Bertha was on the premises. Bertha happened to be out
that morning, and Mrs. Carne surprised Beth sitting alone at a table
covered with books and papers.</p>

<p>"And so the little woman is going to be a great one!" Mrs. Carne
exclaimed playfully. "Well, I <i>was</i> surprised to hear it! I know I am
not flattering to my own discernment when I say so; but there! I should
never have supposed you were a genius. You are such a quiet little
mouse, you know, you don't give yourself away much, if you will excuse
the expression! I always say what I think."</p>

<p>"I hope you will not call me a genius again, Mrs. Carne," Beth said
stiffly. "All exaggeration is distasteful to me."</p>

<p>"And to me, too, my dear child," Mrs. Carne hastened to assure her
blandly. "But I always say what I think, you know."</p>

<p>Beth fixed her eyes on the clock absently.</p>

<p>When Dan came in to lunch that day, he seemed pleased to hear that Mrs.
Carne had been.</p>

<p>"What had she to say for herself?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She said 'I always say what I think,'" Beth replied; "until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> it struck
me that 'I always say what I think' is a person who only thinks
disagreeable things."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> like her," said Dan; "and I always get on with her. If she's
going to show up friendly at last, I hope you won't snub her. We can't
afford to make enemies, according to your own account," he concluded
significantly. "What do you think of her, Miss Petterick?" he added, by
way of giving a pleasanter turn to the conversation. He and his patient
always addressed each other with much formality. Beth asked him once in
private why he was so stiff with Bertha, and he explained that he
thought it wiser, as a medical man, not to be at all familiar; formality
helped to keep up his authority.</p>

<p>"I have had no opportunity of thinking anything about her," Bertha
rejoined. "She has never spoken to me. I have heard her speak, though,
and like her voice. It's so cooing. She makes me think of a dove."</p>

<p>"And I shouldn't be surprised to find," said Beth, with cruel insight,
"that, like the dove, she conceals a villainous disposition and
murderous proclivities by charms of manner and a winning voice. What are
you going to do this afternoon, Bertha?"</p>

<p>Bertha glanced at Dan. "I am going to read 'The Moonstone' out in the
garden the whole afternoon," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then you won't mind if I disappear till tea-time?" said Beth. "I want
to do some work upstairs."</p>

<p>"No, I would rather be alone," Bertha answered frankly. "That book's
entrancing."</p>

<p>"I shall go round on foot this afternoon, for exercise," Dan announced
as he left the room.</p>

<p>Beth saw Bertha settled on a seat in the garden, and then retired to her
secret chamber. She had not yet come to any conclusion with regard to
Mrs. Kilroy's invitation, and she felt it was time she decided. She took
her sewing, her accustomed aid to thought, and sat down on a high chair
near the window. She always sat on a high chair, that she might not be
enervated by lolling; that was one of her patient methods of
self-discipline; and while she meditated, she did quantities of work for
herself, making, mending, remodelling, that she might get all the wear
possible out of her clothes, and not add a penny she could help to those
terrible debts, the thought of which had weighed on her youth, and
threatened to crush all the spirit out of her ever since her marriage.
Dan had never considered her too young to be worried.</p>

<p>From where she sat she could see Bertha on a seat just below, with "The
Moonstone" on her lap, but Bertha could not see her because of the
curtain of creepers that covered the iron rail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span> which formed a little
balcony round the window. Besides, it was supposed that that was a blank
window. It was the only one on that side of the house, too, and Bertha
had settled herself in that secluded corner of the garden precisely
because she thought she could not be overlooked.</p>

<p>Beth glanced at her from time to time mechanically, but without thinking
of her. It struck her at last, however, that Bertha had never opened her
book, which seemed odd after the special point she had made of being
left alone to read it undisturbed. Then Beth noticed that she seemed to
be on the look-out, as if she were expecting something or somebody; and
presently Dan appeared, walking quickly and with a furtive air, as if he
were afraid of being seen. Bertha flushed crimson and became all smiles
as soon as she saw him. Beth's work dropped on her lap, she clasped her
hands on it, her own face flushed, and her breath became laboured. Dan,
after carefully satisfying himself that there was nobody about, sat down
beside Bertha, put his arm round her waist, and kissed her. She giggled,
and made a feeble feint of protesting. Then he took a jewel-case from
his pocket, opened it, and held it out to her admiring gaze. It
contained a handsome gold bracelet, which he presently clasped on her
arm. She expressed her gratitude by lifting up her face to be kissed.
Then he put his arm round her again, and she sat with her head on his
shoulder, and they began to talk; but the conversation was interrupted
by frequent kisses.</p>

<p>Beth had seen enough. She turned her back to the window, and sat quite
still with her hands clasped before her. It was her first experience of
that parasite, the girl who fastens herself on a married woman, accepts
all that she can get from her in the way of hospitality and kindness,
and treacherously repays her by taking her husband for a lover. Beth
pitied Bertha, but with royal contempt. It all seemed so sordid and
despicable. Jealous she was not. "Jealousy is a want of faith in one's
self," she had said to Bertha's mother once, and now, in the face of
this provocation, she was of the same mind. She had no words to express
her scorn for a man who is false to his obligations, nor for the petty
frauds and deceits which had made the position of those two tenable. As
for Dan, he was beneath contempt; but&mdash;"I shall succeed!" The words
sprang to her lips triumphantly. "Let him wallow with his own kind in
congenial mire as much as he likes. No wonder he suspects me! But I&mdash;I
shall succeed!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile down in the garden Dan was gurgling to Bertha: "What should I
do without you, darling? Life wasn't worth having till I knew you. I
won't say a word against Beth. She has her good points, as you know, and
I believe she means well;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
 but she's spoilt my life, and my career too.
I'm one that requires a lot of sympathy; but she never shows me any. She
thinks of nobody but herself. Her own mother always said so. And after
all I've done for her too! If only you knew! But of course I can't blow
my own trumpet. They're all alike in that family, though. Her mother
used to keep me playing cards till I was ruined. And Beth has no
gratitude, and you can't trust her. She comes of a lying lot, and I'm of
the same mind as my old father, who used to say he'd rather have a thief
any day than a liar. You can watch a thief, but you can't watch a liar."</p>

<p>"Still, Dan," Bertha murmured, "I somehow think you ought to stick to
her."</p>

<p>"So I would," said Dan. "No one can accuse me of not sticking to my
duty. I'm an honourable man. It was she who cast me off. I'm nothing to
her. And I should have been broken-hearted but for you, Bertha, I should
indeed." Dan's fine eyes filled with tears, which Bertha tenderly wiped
away.</p>

<p>"Of course it makes a great difference her having cast <i>you</i> off,"
Bertha conceded, after a little interlude.</p>

<p>"It makes <i>all</i> the difference," Dan rejoined. "She set me at liberty,
and you are free too; so who have we to consider but ourselves? I admire
a woman who has the pluck to be free!" he added enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you encourage Beth more to go her own way?" Bertha
reasonably demanded. "She's always yearning for a career."</p>

<p>Dan hesitated. "Because I've been a fool, I think," he said at last.
"I'll encourage her now, though. It would be a great blessing to us if
she could get started as a writer. I see that now. She'd think of
nothing else. And it would be a blessing to her too," he added
feelingly.</p>

<p>"That's what I like about you, Dan," Bertha observed. "You always make
every allowance for her, and consider her interests, although she has
treated you badly."</p>

<p>Dan pressed her hand to his lips. "I'll do what I can for her, you may
be sure," he said, quite melted by his own magnanimity. "I wish I could
do more. But she's been extravagant, and my means are dreadfully
crippled."</p>

<p>"Then why do you buy me such handsome presents, you naughty man?" Bertha
playfully demanded, holding up her arm with the bracelet on it.</p>

<p>"I must have a holiday sometimes," he rejoined. "Besides, I happen to be
expecting a handsome cheque, an unusual occurrence, by any post now."</p>

<p>Beth's dividends were due that day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as dinner was announced, Beth swept into the drawing-room in the
best evening dress she had, a diaphonous black, set off by turquoise
velvet, a combination which threw the beautiful milk-white of her skin
into delicate relief. There was a faint flush on her face; on her
forehead and neck the tendrils of her soft brown hair seemed to have
taken on an extra crispness of curl, and her eyes were sparkling. She
had never looked better. Bertha Petterick, in her common handsomeness,
was as a barmaid accustomed to beer beside a gentlewoman of exceptional
refinement. She wore the showy bracelet Dan had given her that
afternoon, and it shone conspicuous in its tawdry newness on her arm;
her dress was tasteless too, and badly put on, and altogether she
contrasted unfavourably with Beth, and Dan observed it.</p>

<p>"Are you expecting any one in particular to-night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," Beth answered smiling. "I dressed for my own benefit. Nothing
moves me to self-satisfaction like a nice dress. I have not enjoyed the
pleasure much since I married. But I am going to begin now, and have a
good time."</p>

<p>She turned as she spoke and led the way to the dining-room alone. Dr.
Maclure absently offered his arm to Miss Petterick. He was puzzled to
know what this sudden fit of self-assertion, combined with an
unaccountable burst of high spirits on Beth's part, might portend. To
conceal a certain uneasiness, he became extra facetious, not to say
coarse. There was a public ball coming off in a few days, and he
persisted in speaking of it as "The Dairy Show."</p>

<p>"Don't you begin to feel excited about it? I do!" Miss Petterick said to
Beth. "I wish it were to-night."</p>

<p>"I am indifferent," Beth answered blandly, "because I am not going."</p>

<p>"Not going!" Dan exclaimed. "Then who's to chaperon me?"</p>

<p>"I should scarcely suppose," Beth answered, looking at him meditatively,
"that you are in the stage of innocence which makes a chaperon
necessary. Bertha, how you are loving that new bracelet! You've done
nothing but fidget with it ever since we sat down."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Bertha answered archly, "you want to know where I got it, Madam
Curious! Well, I'll tell you. It was sent me only to-day&mdash;by my young
man!"</p>

<p>Dan looked at his plate complacently, but presently Beth saw a glance of
intelligence flash between them&mdash;a glance such as she had often seen
them exchange before, but had not understood; and she was thankful that
she had not!&mdash;thankful that she had been able to live so long with Dr.
Maclure without entertaining a single suspicion, without thinking one
low thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
 about him. It was a hopeful triumph of cultivated
nice-mindedness over the most evil communications.</p>

<p>When they were at dessert, the postman's knock resounded sharply. Dr.
Maclure, who had been anxiously listening for it, and was peeling a pear
for Miss Petterick at the moment, waited with the pear and the knife
upheld in his hands, watching the door till the servant entered. She
brought a letter on a salver, and was taking it to her master, when Beth
said authoritatively, "That letter is for me, Minna; bring it here."</p>

<p>The girl obeyed.</p>

<p>Dan put down the knife and the pear. "What's yours is mine, I thought,"
he observed, with a sorry affectation of cheeriness.</p>

<p>"Not on this occasion," Beth answered quietly, taking up the letter and
opening it as she spoke. "This happens to be peculiarly my own."</p>

<p>"Why, it's a cheque," he rejoined, with an affectation of surprise.
"What luck! I haven't been able to sleep for nights thinking of the
butcher's bill."</p>

<p>"For shame!" Beth said, bantering&mdash;"talking about bills before your
guest! But since you introduced the subject I may add that the butcher
must wait. I want this myself. I am going to stay with Mrs. Kilroy at
Ilverthorpe on Wednesday, and it will just cover my expenses."</p>

<p>"This is the first I have heard of the visit," Dan ejaculated.</p>

<p>"I only decided to go this afternoon," Beth replied.</p>

<p>"You decided without consulting me? Well&mdash;I'm damned if you shall go; I
shall not allow it."</p>

<p>"The word 'allow' is obsolete in the matrimonial dictionary, friend
Daniel," Beth rejoined good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"But you are bound to obey me."</p>

<p>"And I'm ready to obey you when you endow me with all your worldly
goods," she said; then, suddenly dropping her bantering tone, she spoke
decidedly: "I am going to stay with Mrs. Kilroy on Wednesday, understand
that at once, and do not let us have any vulgar dispute about it."</p>

<p>"But you can't leave Miss Petterick here alone with me!" he
remonstrated.</p>

<p>"No, but she can go home," Beth answered coolly. "Her mother wants her,
you know, and I have written to tell her to expect her to-morrow. Now,
if you please, we will end the discussion."</p>

<p>She put the letter in her pocket, and began to crack nuts and eat them.
But Dan could not keep away from the subject. "Gad!" he ejaculated, "I
thought they'd get hold of you, that lot, and flatter you, and make a
convenience of you&mdash;that's what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
 they do! <i>I</i> know them! They think
you're clever&mdash;how easy it is to be mistaken! But you'll see for
yourself in time, and then you'll believe me&mdash;when it's too late. For
then you'll have got your name mixed up with them, and you'll not get
over that, I can tell you&mdash;they are well known for a nice lot. Your Mrs.
Kilroy was notorious before she married. She was Angelica
Hamilton-Wells, and she and her brother were called the Heavenly Twins.
They are grandchildren of that blackguard old Duke of Morningquest.
Nobody ever speaks of any of the family with the slightest respect. It's
well known that Miss Hamilton-Wells asked old Kilroy to marry her, and
when a girl has to do that, you may guess what she is! But they are all
besmirched, that lot," Dan concluded with his most high-minded manner
on.</p>

<p>"I never believe anything I hear against anybody," said Beth,
unconsciously quoting Ideala; "so please spare me the recital of all
invidious stories."</p>

<p>"You'll only believe what suits yourself, I know," he said. "And I've no
doubt you'll enjoy yourself. Galbraith will be there, and Mr. Theodore
Hamilton-Wells, the fair-haired 'Diavolo,' who will suit your book
exactly, I should think."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" said Beth politely.</p>

<p>Dan poured himself out another glass of wine, and said no more.</p>

<p>He and Bertha managed to have a moment's conversation together before
they retired that night.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" Bertha anxiously demanded. "Does she suspect
anything?"</p>

<p>"God knows!" Dan said piously, then added, after a moment's
consideration, "How the devil can she? We've played our cards too well
for that! No, she's just bent on making mischief; that's the kind of
pill she is. If she keeps that money it will be downright robbery. But
now you see what I have to put up with, and you can judge for yourself
if I deserve it."</p>

<p>When he went to Beth, however, he assumed a very different tone. He
entered the room with an air of deep dejection, and found her sitting
beside her dressing-table in a white wrapper, reading quietly. She
smiled when she saw his pose. It was what she had expected.</p>

<p>"I can't do without that money, Beth, on my word," he began plaintively.
"I've been reckoning on it. I wouldn't take it from you, God knows, if I
could help it; but I'm sore pressed." He took out his handkerchief and
wiped his eyes, imagining that he still had to deal with the gentle
sensitive girl, upon whom he had imposed so long and so successfully.</p>

<p>Beth watched him a moment with contempt, and then she laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is no use, friend Daniel," she said in her neat, incisive,
straightforward way. "I am not going to take you seriously any more. I
am neither to be melted by your convenient tears, nor dismayed by your
bogey bills. I have never seen any of those bills, by the way; the next
time you mention them, please produce them. Let us be business-like. And
in the meantime, just understand, once for all, like a good man, that I
am not going to be domineered over by you as if I were a common degraded
wife with every spark of spirit and self-respect crushed out of me by
one brutal exaction or another. I shall do my duty&mdash;do my best to meet
your reasonable wishes; but I will submit to no ordering and no sort of
exaction." She rose and faced him. "And as we are coming to an
understanding," she pursued, "just explain. Why did you tell me that
Miss Petterick was to be a paying patient?"</p>

<p>"I never told you anything of the kind," said Dan, losing his head, and
lying stupidly in his astonishment.</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders. "It is your own business," she
rejoined&mdash;"at least it is you who will have to pay for her
entertainment."</p>

<p>She returned to her book as she spoke, and continued to read with
apparent calmness.</p>

<p>Now that she had taken up her position, she found herself quite strong
enough to hold it against any Dan Maclure or Bertha Petterick. But Beth
was being forced into an ugly and vulgar phase, and she knew and
resented it, and was filled with dismay. She was taking on something of
the colour of her surroundings involuntarily, inevitably, as certain
insects do, in self-defence. She had spoken to Dan in his own tone in
order to make him understand her; but was it necessary? Surely if she
had resisted the impulse to try that weapon, she might have found
another as effective, the use of which would not have compromised her
gentlehood and lessened her self-esteem. Her dissatisfaction with
herself for the part she had played was a cruel ache, and she thanked
Heaven for the chance which would mercifully remove her from that evil
atmosphere for a while, and prayed for time to reflect, for strength to
be her better self. She was angry with herself, and grieved because she
had fought Dan with his own weapons, and it did not occur to her for her
comfort that she had only done so because he was invulnerable to that
which she would naturally have used&mdash;earnest, reasonable, calm
discussion&mdash;and that fight him she must with something, somehow, or sink
for ever down to the degraded level required of their wives by husbands
of his way of thinking.

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Ilverthorpe</span> was at the other side of the county,
 and Beth had to go from
Slane to Morningquest by train in order to get there. Dan continued to
be disagreeable in private about her going, but he took her to the
station, and saw her off, so that the public might know what an
admirable husband he was.</p>

<p>On his way from the station he met Sir George Galbraith, and greeted him
with effusion.</p>

<p>"I hope you were coming to see us," he said, "for that would show that
you don't forget our humble existence. But my wife isn't at home, I am
sorry to say. She has just gone to stay with Mrs. Kilroy."</p>

<p>Sir George looked keenly at him. "I hope she is quite well," he said
formally.</p>

<p>"Not too well," Dan answered lugubriously; "and that is why I encouraged
her to go. The fact is, Sir George, I think I've been making a mistake
with Beth. My mother was my perfection of a woman. She didn't care much
for books; but she had good sound common-sense, and she attended to her
husband and her household, and preferred to stay at home; and I confess
I wanted my wife to be like her. Especially I wanted to keep her
pure-minded and unsuspicious of evil; and <i>that</i> she could not remain if
she got drawn into Mrs. Kilroy's set, and mixed up with the questions
about which women are now agitating themselves. I know you're with them
and not with me in the matter, but you'll allow for my point of view.
Well, with regard to Beth, I find I've made a mistake. I should have let
her follow her own bent, see for herself, and become a woman of the day
if she's so minded. As it is, she is growing morbid for want of an
outlet, and hanging back herself, and it is I who have to urge her on.
It's an heroic operation so far as I'm concerned, for the whole thing is
distasteful to me; but I shall go through with it, and let her be as
independent as she likes."</p>

<p>"This sounds like self-sacrifice," said Sir George. "I sincerely hope it
may answer. We are going different ways, I think. Good-morning." He
raised his hand to his hat in a perfunctory way, and hurried off. The
next time he saw Mrs. Kilroy, he described this encounter with Dr.
Maclure.</p>

<p>"This is a complete change of front," said Angelica; "what does it
mean?"</p>

<p>"When a man of that kind tells his wife to make the most of her life in
her own way and be independent, he means '<i>Don't bother me; another
woman is the delight of my senses!</i>' When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
 says to the other woman
'<i>Be free!</i>' he means '<i>Throw yourself into my arms!</i>'"</p>

<p>Angelica sighed. "Poor Beth!" she said, "what a fate to be tied to that
plausible hog!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>From having been so much shut up in herself, Beth showed very little of
the contrasts of her temperament on the surface,&mdash;her joy in life, her
moments of exaltation, of devotion, of confidence, of harshness, of
tenderness; her awful fits of depression, her doubts, her fears, her
self-distrust; her gusts of passion, and the disconnected impulses
wedged into the well-disciplined routine of a consistent life, ordered
for the most part by principle, reason, and reflection. Few people,
meeting her casually, would have suspected any contrasts at all; and
even of those who knew her best, only one now and then appreciated the
rate at which the busy mind was working, and the changes wrought by the
growth which was continually in progress beneath her equable demeanour.
Those about her, for want of discernment, expected nothing of her, and
suffered shocks of surprise in consequence, which they resented, blaming
her for their own defects.</p>

<p>But it was of much more importance to Beth that she should be able to
pass on with ease from one thing to another than that she should have
the approval of people who would have had her stay where they found her,
not for her benefit, but for their own convenience in classifying her.
Beth made stepping-stones of her knowledge of other people rather than
of her own dead self. She picked to pieces the griefs they brought upon
her, dissected them, and moralised upon them; and, in so doing, forgot
the personal application. While in the midst of what might have been her
own life tragedy, she compared herself with those who had been through
theirs and did not seem a bit the worse or the better, which observation
stimulated her fortitude; when she contemplated the march of events,
that mighty army of atoms, any one of which may be in command of us for
a time, none remaining so for ever under healthy conditions, she
perceived that life is lived in detail, not in the abstract. The kind of
thing that makes the backbone of a three-volume novel, is but a phase or
an incident; everything is but an incident with all of us, a heart-break
to-day, a recollection to-morrow, a source of encouragement and of
inspiration eventually perhaps; the which, if some would remember, there
would be less despair and fewer suicides. The recognition of this fact
had helped Beth's sense of proportion and was making her philosophical.
She believed that life could be lived so as to make the joys as
inevitable as the sorrows. We are apt to cultivate our sense of pleasure
less than our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
 sense of suffering, by appreciating small pleasures
little, while heeding small pains excessively. Beth's deliberate
intention, as well as her natural impulse, was to reverse this in her
own case as much as possible; she would not let her physical sense of
well-being on a fine morning and her intellectual delight in a good mood
for work be spoilt because of some trouble of the night before. The
trouble she would set aside so that it might not detract from the
pleasure.</p>

<p>But fine mornings and good moods for work had not come to her aid since
she discovered the mean treachery of Dan and Bertha, and when she left
Slane she was still oppressed by the sense of their hypocrisy and
deceit. As the train bore her swiftly away from them both, however, her
spirits rose. The sun shone, the country looked lovely in its autumn
bravery of tint and tone; she felt well, and the contemplation of such
people as Dan and Bertha was not elevating; they must out of her mind
like any other unholy thought, that she might be worthy to associate
with the loyal ladies and noble gentlemen whose hands were outheld to
help her. The people we cling to are those with whom we find ourselves
most at home. It is not the people who amuse us that we like best, but
those who stir our deeper emotions, rouse in us possibilities of
generous feeling which lie latent for the most part, and give form to
our higher aspirations; and Beth anticipated with a happy heart that it
was with such she was bound to abide.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kilroy met her at the station at Morningquest. "What a bonny thing
you are!" she exclaimed in her queer abrupt way. "I didn't realise it
till I saw you walking up the platform towards me. There's a cart to
take your luggage to Ilverthorpe. Do you mind coming to lunch with Mrs.
Orton Beg? She has a dear little house in the Close, and we thought you
might like to see the Cathedral. Here's the carriage. No, you get in
first."</p>

<p>"But does Mrs. Orton Beg want me?" Beth asked when they were seated.</p>

<p>"We all want you," said Mrs. Kilroy, "if you will forgive our first
mistake with regard to you, and come out of yourself and be one of us.
And you'll be specially fond of Mrs. Orton Beg when you know her, I
fancy. She's just sweet! She used to hate our works and ways, and be
very conventional; but Edith Beale's marriage opened her eyes. She would
never have believed that men countenanced such an iniquity had she not
seen it herself. The first effect of the shock was to narrow her
judgment and make her severe on men generally; but she will get over
that in time. Man, like woman, is too big a subject to generalise about.
He has his faults, you know, but he must be educated; that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> all he
wants. He must be taught to have a better opinion of himself. At
present, he wallows because he thinks he can't keep out of the mire; but
of course he can when he learns how. He's not a bit worse than woman
naturally, only he has a lower opinion of himself, and that keeps him
down. With his training we shouldn't be a bit better than he is. In all
things that concern men and women, you dear, you will find that, when
they start fair, one is not a bit better or worse than the other. Here
we are."</p>

<p>Mrs. Orton Beg came into the hall to greet her guest. She was a slender,
elegant, middle-aged woman, in graceful black draperies, with hair
prematurely grey, and a face that had always been interesting, but never
handsome&mdash;a refined, intellectual, but not strong face; the face of a
patient, self-contained, long-enduring person, of settled purpose,
slowly arrived at, and then not easily shaken. She welcomed Beth
cordially, and placed her at table so that she might look out at the old
grey Cathedral. It was the first time Beth had seen it, and she could
have lost herself in the sensation of realising its traditions, its
beauty, and its age; but the conversation went on briskly, and she had
to take her part. Lady Fulda Guthrie, an aunt of Mrs. Kilroy's, was the
only other guest. She was a beautiful saint, with a soul which had
already progressed as far as the most spiritual part of Catholicism
could take it, and she could get no farther in this incarnation.</p>

<p>"I hope you are prepared to discuss any and every thing, Mrs. Maclure,"
Mrs. Orton Beg warned Beth; "for that is what you will find yourself
called upon to do among us. The peculiarity of man is that he will do
the most atrocious things without compunction, but would be shocked if
he were called upon to discuss them. Do what you like, is his principle,
but don't mention it; people form their opinions in discussion, and
opinions are apt to be adverse. Our principle is very much the
opposite."</p>

<p>"I have just begun to know the necessity for open discussion," Beth
answered tranquilly. "I do not see how we can arrive at happiness in
life if we do not try to discover the sources of misery. I know of
nothing that earnest men and women should hesitate to discuss openly on
proper occasions."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm thankful to hear you say 'men and women,'" Angelica broke in.
"That is the right new spirit! Let us help one another. Any attempt to
separate the interests of the sexes, as women here and there, and men
generally, would have them separated, is fatal to the welfare of the
whole race. The efforts of foolish people to divide the interests of men
and women make me writhe&mdash;as if we were not utterly bound up in one
another, and destined to rise or fall together! But this woman movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
is towards the perfecting of life, not towards the disruption of it. I
asked a sympathetic woman the other day why she took no part in it, and
she answered profoundly, 'Because I am a part <i>of</i> it.' And I am sure
she was right. I am sure it is evolutionary. It is an effort of the race
to raise itself a step higher in the scale of being. For see what it
resolves itself into! Men respond to what women expect of them. When
warriors were the women's ideal, men were warriors. When women preferred
knights, priests, or troubadours, a man's ambition was to be a knight,
priest, or troubadour. When women thought drunkenness fine, men were
drunken. Now women want husbands of a nobler nature, strong in all the
attributes, moral and physical, of the perfect man, that their children
may be noble too, and thus the ascent of man to higher planes of being
become assured."</p>

<p>"Great is the power of thought," said Lady Fulda. "By thinking these
things the race is evolving them. Thought married to suggestion is a
creative force. If the race believed it would have wings; in the course
of ages wings would come of the faith."</p>

<p>"And discussion is not enough," Beth resumed. "We should experiment. It
is very well to hold opinions and set up theories, but opinions and
theories are alike valueless until they are tested by experiment."</p>

<p>"I see you are a true radical," said Mrs. Orton Beg. "You would go to
the root of the matter."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I am a radical in that sense of the word," Beth answered. "I
have a horror of conservatism. Nothing is stationary. All things are
always in a state of growth or decay; and conservatism is a state of
decay."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angelica. "That is very true, especially as applied to
women&mdash;if they are ever to advance."</p>

<p>"Then don't you think they are advancing?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Angelica, "but not as much as they might. When you mix more
with them in the way of work you will be disheartened. Women are their
own worst enemies just now. They don't follow their leaders loyally and
consistently; they have little idea of discipline; their tendency is to
go off on side issues and break up into little cliques. They are largely
actuated by petty personal motives, by petty jealousies, by pettinesses
of all kinds. One amongst them will arise here and there, and do
something great that is an honour to them all; but they do not honour
her for it&mdash;perhaps because something in the way she dresses, or some
trick of manner, does not meet with the approval of the majority. Women
are for ever stumbling over trifling details. To prove themselves right
pleases them better than to arrive at the truth; and a vulgar personal
triumph is of more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
 moment than the triumph of a great cause. In these
things they are practically not a bit better than men."</p>

<p>"They seem worse, in fact, because we expect so much more of them in the
way of loyalty and disinterestedness," said Mrs. Orton Beg; "and their
power is so much greater, too, in social matters; when they misuse it,
they do much more harm. This will not always be so, of course. As their
minds expand, they will see and understand better. At present they do
not know enough to appreciate their own deficiencies&mdash;they do not
measure the weakness of their vacillations by comparing it with the
steady strength of purpose that prevails; and, for want of
comprehension, they aim their silly animadversions to-day at some one
whose work they are glad enough to profit by to-morrow; they make the
task of a benefactress so hard that they kill her, and then they give
her a public funeral. I pity them!"</p>

<p>"Oh, do not be hasty," said Lady Fulda. "Human beings are not like packs
of cards, to be shuffled into different combinations at will and nobody
the worse. There are feelings to be considered. The old sores must be
tenderly touched even by those who would heal them. And when we uproot
we must be careful to replant under more favourable conditions; when we
demolish we should be prepared to rebuild, or no comfort will come of
the changes. These things take time, and are best done deliberately, and
even then the most cautious make their mistakes. But, still, I believe
that the force which is carrying us along is the force that makes for
righteousness. We women have in our minds now what will culminate in the
recognition by future generations of the beauty of goodness. Woman is to
be the mother of God in Man."</p>

<p>Beth's heart swelled at the words. This attitude was new to her; and yet
all that was said she seemed to have heard before, and known from the
first. And she knew more also, away back in that region beyond time and
space to which she had access, and where she found herself at happy
moments transported by an impulse outside herself, which she could not
control by any effort of will. That day, with those new friends, she
felt like one who returns to a happy home after weary wanderings, and is
warmly welcomed. A great calm settled upon her spirit. She said little
the whole time, but sat, sure of their sympathetic tolerance, and
listened to them with that living light of interest in her eyes to which
the heart responds with confidence more surely than to any spoken word.
The evil influences which had held her tense at Slane had no power to
trouble her here. She was high enough above Dan and Bertha to look down
upon them dispassionately, knowing them for what they were, yet
personally unaffected by their turpitude. It was as if she had heard of
some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
 bad deed, and knew it to be repulsive, a thing intolerable,
meriting punishment; yet, because it did not concern her, it had lapsed
from her thoughts like a casual paragraph read in a paper which had not
brought home to her any realisation of what it recorded.</p>

<p>During the afternoon her mind was stored with serene
impressions&mdash;service in the venerable Cathedral; the fluting of an
anthem by a boy with a birdlike voice; some strong words from the
pulpit, not on the dry bones of doctrine, nor the doings of a barbarous
people led by a vengeful demon of perplexing attributes whom they
worshipped as a deity, but on the conduct of life&mdash;a vital subject.
Then, as they drove through the beautiful old city, there came
impressions of grey and green; grey gateways, ancient buildings, ivy,
and old trees, and, over all, sounding slow, calm, and significant, the
marvellous chime, the message which Morningquest heard hourly year by
year, and heeded no more than it heeded death at a distance or political
complications in Peru.</p>

<p>The same party met again at Ilverthorpe, but there were others there as
well&mdash;Ideala, Mrs. Kilroy's father and mother Mr. and Lady Adeline
Hamilton-Wells, and Lady Galbraith, but not Sir George.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room after dinner, Beth was intent upon a portfolio of
drawings, and Ideala, seeing her alone, went up to her.</p>

<p>"Are you fond of pictures?" she said to Beth.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just the word," Beth answered. "I am so 'fond' of them
that even such a collection as this, which shows great industry rather
than great art, I find full of interest, and delight in. Happy for me,
perhaps, that I don't know anything about technique. Subject appeals to
my imagination as it used to do when I was a child, and loved to linger
over the pictures on old-fashioned pieces of music. Those pictures lure
me still with strange sensations such as no others make me feel. I wish
I could realise now as vividly as I realised then the beauty of that
lovely lady on the song, and the whole pathetic story&mdash;the gem that
decked her queenly brow and bound her raven hair, remained a sad
memorial of blighted love's despair; and that other young creature who
wore a wreath of roses on the night when first we met; and the one who
related that we met, 'twas in a crowd, and I thought he would shun me;
he came, I could not breathe, for his eye was upon me, and concluded
that 'twas thou that had caused me this anguish, my mother. There was
the gallant corsair, too, just stepping out of a boat, waving his hat.
His curly hair, open shirt collar, and black tie with flying ends remain
in my mind, intimately associated with Byron, young love, some who never
smiled again, the sapphire night, crisp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
 clear, cold, thick-strewn with
stars, all sparkling with frosty brightness&mdash;impressions I would not
exchange for art understood, or anything I am capable of feeling now
before the greatest work of art in the world&mdash;so strangely am I
blunted."</p>

<p>"What, already!" Ideala said compassionately. "But that is only a phase.
You will come out of it, and be young again and feel strongly, which is
better than knowing, I concede. The truest appreciation of a work of art
does not take place in the head, but in the heart; not in thinking, but
in feeling. When we stand before a picture, it is not by the thoughts
formulated in the mind, but by the appreciation which suffuses our whole
being with pleasure that we should estimate it."</p>

<p>"But isn't that a sensuous attitude?" Beth objected.</p>

<p>"Yes, of the right kind," Ideala rejoined. "The senses have their uses,
you know. And it is exactly your attitude as a child towards the
pictures on the songs. You felt it all&mdash;all the full significance&mdash;long
before you knew it so that you could render it into words; and felt
more, probably, than you will ever be able to express. Feeling is the
first stage of fine thought."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton-Wells strolled towards them. He was a rather tall,
exceedingly thin man, with straight, thick, grey-brown hair, parted in
the middle, and plastered down on either side of his head. He was
dressed in black velvet. His long thin white hands were bedecked with
handsome antique rings, art treasures in their way. One intaglio, carved
in red coral, caught the eye especially, on the first finger of his
right hand. As he talked he had a trick of shaking his hands back with a
gesture that suggested lace ruffles getting in the way, and in his whole
appearance and demeanour there was something that recalled the days when
velvet and lace were in vogue for gentlemen. He spoke with great
preciseness, and it was not always possible to be sure that he at all
appreciated the effect of the extraordinary remarks he was in the habit
of making; which apparent obliviousness enabled him to discourse about
many things without offence which other people were obliged to leave
unmentioned.</p>

<p>"Nowadays, when I see two ladies together in a corner, talking
earnestly," he observed, "I always suspect that they are discussing the
sex question."</p>

<p>"Oh, the sex question!" Ideala exclaimed. "I am sick of sex! Sex is a
thing to be endured or enjoyed, not to be discussed."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Hamilton-Wells, nodding slowly, as if in profound
consideration, and shaking back his imaginary ruffles. "Is that your
opinion, Mrs. Maclure?"</p>

<p>"I keep a separate compartment in my mind for the sex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> question," Beth
answered, colouring&mdash;"a compartment which has to be artificially
lighted. There is no ray of myself that would naturally penetrate to it.
When I take up a book, and find that it is nothing but <i>she was
beautiful, he loved her</i>, I put it down again with a groan. The monotony
of the subject palls upon me. It is the stock-in-trade of every author,
as if there were nothing of interest in the lives of men and women but
their sexual relations."</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes," said Mr. Hamilton-Wells, with bland deliberation, "but
society thinks of nothing else. Blatant sexuality is the predominant
characteristic of the upper classes, and the rage for the sexual passion
is principally set up and fostered by a literature inflated with
sexuality, and by costumes which seem to be designed for the purpose. In
the evening, now, just think! Even quite elderly ladies, with a laudable
desire to please, offer themselves in evening dress&mdash;and a very great
deal of themselves sometimes&mdash;to the eye that may be attracted."</p>

<p>When he had spoken, he shook back his imaginary ruffles, brought his
hands together in front of him with the fingers tip to tip in a pious
attitude, and strolled up the long room slowly, shaking his head at
intervals with an intent expression, as if he were praying for society.</p>

<p>"What a bomb!" Beth gasped. "Is he always so?"</p>

<p>"Generally," Ideala rejoined. "And I can never make out whether he means
well, but is stupid and tactless, or whether he delights to spring such
explosives on inoffensive people. He sits on a Board of Guardians
composed of ladies and gentlemen, and the other day, at one of their
meetings, he proposed to remove the stigma attaching to illegitimacy. He
said that illegitimacy cannot justly be held to reflect on anybody's
conduct, since, so he had always understood, illegitimacy was birth from
natural causes."</p>

<p>"And what happened?"</p>

<p>Ideala slightly shrugged her shoulders. "The proposition was seriously
discussed, and a parson and one or two other members of the board
threatened to retire if he remained on it. But remain he did, and let
them retire; and I cannot help fancying that his whole object was to get
them to go. Sometimes I think that he must have a peculiar sense of
humour, which it gives him great gratification to indulge, as others do
good, by stealth. He makes questionable jests for himself only, and
enjoys them alone. But apart from this eccentricity, he is a kind and
generous man, always ready to help with time and money when there is any
good to be done."</p>

<p>When Beth went to her room that night, she experienced a strange sense
of satisfaction which she could not account for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span> until she found herself
alone, with no fear of being disturbed. It seemed to her then that she
had never before known what comfort was, never slept in such a
delightful bed, so fresh and cool and sweet. She was like one who has
been bathed and perfumed after the defilements of a long dusty journey,
and is able to rest in peace. As she stretched herself between the
sheets, she experienced a blessed sensation of relief, which was a
revelation to her. Until that moment, she had never quite realised the
awful oppression of her married life; the inevitable degradation of
intimate association with such a man as her husband.</p>

<p>The next day the ladies went out to sit on the lawn together in the
shade of the trees, with their books and work. There were no sounds but
such as, in the country, seem to accentuate the quiet, and are aids, not
to thought, but to that higher faculty which awakes in the silence, and
is to thought what the mechanical instrument is to the voice.</p>

<p>"How heavenly still it is!" Beth ejaculated. "It stirs me&mdash;fills me&mdash;how
shall I express it?&mdash;makes me cognisant in some sort&mdash;conscious of
things I don't know&mdash;things beyond all this, and even better worth our
attention. The stillness here in these surroundings has the same benign
effect on me that perfect solitude has elsewhere. What a luxury it is,
though&mdash;solitude! I mean the privilege of being alone when one feels the
necessity. I am fortunate, however," she added quickly, lest she should
seem to be making a personal complaint, "in that I have a secret chamber
all to myself, and so high up that I can almost hear what the wind
whispers to the stars to make them twinkle. I go there when I want to be
alone to think my thoughts, and no one disturbs me&mdash;not even my nearest
neighbours, the angels; though if they did sometimes, I should not
complain."</p>

<p>"They come closer than you think, perhaps," said Lady Fulda, who had
just strolled up, with a great bunch of lilies on her arm. "Consider the
lilies," she went on, holding them out to Beth. "Look into them. Think
about them. No, though, do not think about them&mdash;feel. There is
purification in the sensation of their beauty."</p>

<p>"Is purification always possible?" Beth said. "Can evil ever be cast out
once it has taken root in the mind?"</p>

<p>"Are you speaking of thoughts or acts, I wonder?" Lady Fulda rejoined,
sitting down beside Beth and looking dreamily into her flowers. "You
know what we hold here: that no false step is irretrievable so long as
we desire what is perfectly right. It is not the things we know of, nor
even the things we have done, if the act is not habitual,&mdash;but the
things we approve of that brand us as bad. The woman whose principles
are formed out of a knowledge of good and evil is better, is more to be
relied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
 upon, than the woman who does not know enough to choose between
them. It is not what the body does, but what the mind thinks that
corrupts us."</p>

<p>"But from certain deeds evil thoughts are inseparable," Beth sighed;
"and surely toleration of evil comes from undue familiarity with it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you do not keep your condemnation side by side with your
knowledge of it," Lady Fulda agreed.</p>

<p>The night before she returned to Slane, Beth attended a meeting of the
new order which Ideala had founded. It was the first thing of the kind
she had been to, and she was much interested in the proceedings. Only
women were present. Beth was one of a semicircle of ladies who sat on
the platform behind the chair. There were subjects of grave social
importance under discussion, and most of the speaking was exceedingly
good, wise, temperate, and certainly not wanting in humour.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the evening there was an awkward pause because a lady
who was to have spoken had not arrived. Mrs. Kilroy, who was in the
chair, looked round for some one to fill the gap, and caught Beth's eye.</p>

<p>"May I speak?" Beth whispered eagerly, leaning over to her. "I have
something to say."</p>

<p>Angelica nodded, gave the audience Beth's name, and then leant back in
her chair. The shorthand writers looked up indifferently, not expecting
to hear anything worth recording.</p>

<p>Beth went forward to the edge of the platform with a look of intentness
on her delicate face, and utterly oblivious of herself, or anything else
but her subject. She never thought of asking herself if she could speak.
All she considered was what she was going to say. She clasped her
slender hands in front of her, and began, slowly, with the formula she
had heard the other speakers use: "Madam Chairman, ladies&mdash;" She paused,
then suddenly spoke out on <i>The Desecration of Marriage</i>.</p>

<p>At the first resonant notes of her clear, dispassionate voice, there was
a movement of interest, a kind of awakening, in the hall, and the ladies
on the platform behind her, who had been whispering to each other,
writing notes and passing them about, and paying more attention to the
business of the meeting generally than to the speakers, paused and
looked up.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ideala, with kindling eyes, leant over to Mrs. Orton Beg,
grasped her arm, and said something eagerly. Mrs. Orton Beg nodded. The
word went round. Beth held the hall, and was still rising from point to
point, carrying the audience with her to a pitch of excitement which
finally culminated in a great burst of applause.</p>

<p>Beth, taken aback, stopped short, surprised and bewildered by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span> the
racket; looked about her, faltered a few more words, and then sat down
abruptly.</p>

<p>The applause was renewed and prolonged.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" Beth asked Ideala in an agony. "Did I say something
absurd?"</p>

<p>"My dear child," Ideala answered, laughing, "they are not jeering, but
cheering!"</p>

<p>"Is that cheering?" Beth exclaimed in an awe-stricken tone, overcome to
find she had produced such an effect. "I feared they meant to be
derisive."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were a speaker," Mrs. Orton Beg whispered.</p>

<p>"I am not," Beth answered apologetically. "I never spoke before, nor
heard any one else speak till to-night. Only I have thought and thought
about these things, and I could not keep it back, what I had to say."</p>

<p>"That is the stuff an orator is made of," some strange lady muttered
approvingly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Beth returned to Slane, Dan received
her so joyously she wondered
what particularly successful piece of turpitude he had been busy about.
He was always effusive to her when evil things went well with him. At
first she had supposed that this effusiveness was the outcome of
affection for her; but when she began to know him, she perceived that it
was only the expression of some personal gratification. He had been
quite demonstrative in his attentions to her during the time that Bertha
Petterick stayed in the house.</p>

<p>"By the way, there is a letter for you," he said, when they were at
lunch.</p>

<p>"Is there?" Beth answered. "Who from?"</p>

<p>"How the devil am I to know?" he rejoined, glancing up at the
mantelpiece. "I can't tell who your correspondents are by instinct."</p>

<p>Beth's eye followed his to the mantelpiece, where she saw a large square
envelope propped up against an ornament in a conspicuous position, and
recognised the unmistakable, big, clear, firm hand of Bertha Petterick,
and the thick kind of paper she always used.</p>

<p>Beth had been thinking about Bertha on the way home. She knew that, if
Bertha had been as wrong in body as in mind and moral nature, she would
have had compassion on her; and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
 had determined to tolerate her as
it was, to do what she could for her maimed soul, just as she would have
ministered to her had her malady been physical. But Dan's hypocrisy
about the letter ruffled her into opposition. He knew Bertha's
handwriting as well as she did, and was doubtless equally well
acquainted with the contents of the letter; and this affectation of
ignorance must therefore mean something special. Probably he was anxious
to propitiate her with regard to whatever Bertha might be writing about.
But Beth was not to be managed in that way, and so she let the letter
be.</p>

<p>As she was leaving the room after lunch, Dan called after her: "You have
forgotten your letter."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," Beth answered. "Any time will do for that."</p>

<p>The letter was left there for days unopened, and it had the effect of
stopping the conversation at meals, for although Dan did not allude to
it again, he constantly glanced at it, and it was evident that he had it
on his mind.</p>

<p>At last, one day, when he came in, he said, "I have just seen Mrs.
Petterick, and she tells me Bertha wrote to you days ago, and has had no
answer."</p>

<p>"Indeed," Beth observed indifferently. "I shouldn't think she could have
anything to say to me that specially required an answer."</p>

<p>Dan fidgeted about a little, then burst out suddenly, "Why the devil
don't you open the girl's letter?"</p>

<p>"Because you pretended you didn't know who it was from," Beth said.</p>

<p>"I declare to God I never pretended anything of the kind," Dan answered
hotly.</p>

<p>Beth laughed. Then she went to the mantelpiece, took down the letter,
turned it over and displayed the huge monogram and scroll with "Bertha"
printed on it, with which it was bedizened, laughed again a little, and
threw the letter unopened into the fire, "There!" she said. "Let that be
an end of the letter, and Bertha Petterick too, so far as I am
concerned. She bores me, that girl; I will not be bothered with her."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Dan exclaimed pathetically, looking hard at the ashes of
the letter on the coals: "that's gratitude! I do my best to make an
honest living for you, and you repay me by affronting one of my best
patients. And what the unfortunate girl has done to offend you, the
devil only knows. I'm sure she would have blacked your boots for you
when she was here, she was so devoted."</p>

<p>"She <i>was</i> pretty servile, I grant that," Beth answered dispassionately.
"But that is enough of Bertha Petterick, please.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> Here is the butcher's
bill for the last month, and the baker's, the milk, the wine, the
groceries, all nearly doubled on Bertha's account. If adding to your
expenses in every way makes a good patient, she was excellent,
certainly. I'll leave you the bills to console you; but, if you value
your peace of mind, don't dare to worry <i>me</i> about them. You were quite
right when you said I was too young to be troubled about money matters,
and I shall not let myself be troubled&mdash;especially when they are
matters, like these bills, for which I am not responsible." She was
leaving the room as she spoke, but stopped at the door: "And, Dan," she
added, quoting his favourite phrase, "I'd be cheery if I were you.
There's nothing like being cheery. Why, look at me! I never let anything
worry me!"</p>

<p>She left Dan speechless, and went to her secret chamber, where she sat
and suffered for an hour, blaming herself for her lightness, her
contrariness, her want of dignity, and all those faults which were the
direct consequence of Dan's evil influence. She was falling farther and
farther away from her ideal in everything, and knew it, but seemed to
have lost the power to save herself. The degeneration had begun in small
matters of discipline, apparently unimportant, but each one of
consequence, in reality, as part of her system of self-control. From the
moment we do a thing thinking it to be wrong, we degenerate. If it be a
principle that we abandon, it does not matter what the principle is, our
whole moral fibre is loosened by the gap it makes. Beth, who had
hitherto shunned easy-chairs, as Aunt Victoria had taught her, lest she
should be enervated by lolling, now began to take to them, and so lost
the strengthening effect of a wholesome effort. Other little
observances, too, little regular habits which discipline mind and body
to such good purpose, slipped from her,&mdash;such as the care of her skin
after the manner of the ladies of her family, who had been renowned for
their wonderful complexions. This had been enjoined upon her by her
mother in her early girlhood as a solemn duty, and had entailed much
self-denial in matters of food and drink, quantities being restricted,
and certain things prohibited at certain times, while others were
forbidden altogether. She had had to exercise patience, also, in the
concoction and use of delicately perfumed washes of tonic and emollient
properties, home distilled, so as to be perfectly pure; all of which had
been strictly practised by her, like sacred rites or superstitious
observances upon the exact performance of which good fortune depends. In
such matters she now became lax. And, besides the care of her person,
she neglected the care of her clothes, which had been so beneficial to
her mind; for it must be remembered that it was during those long hours
of meditation, while she sat sewing, that her reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> had been
digested, her knowledge assimilated, her opinions formed, and her random
thoughts collected and arranged, ready to be turned to account on an
emergency. Until this time, too, she had kept Sunday strictly as a day
of rest. Books and work, and all else that had occupied her during the
week, were put away on Saturday night, and not taken out again until
Monday morning; and the consequence was complete mental relaxation. But
now she began to do all kinds of little things which she had hitherto
thought it wrong to do on Sunday, so that the sanitary effect of the day
of rest&mdash;or of change of occupation, for sometimes Sunday duties are
arduous&mdash;was gradually lost, and she no longer returned to her work on
Monday strengthened and refreshed. Little by little her "good reading"
was also neglected, and instead of relying upon her own resolution, as
had hitherto been her wont, she began to seek the prop of an odd cup of
tea or coffee at irregular hours, to raise her spirits if she felt down,
or stimulate her if she were out of sorts and work was not easy; all of
which tended to weaken her will. Then, by degrees, she began to lose the
balance of mind which had been wont to carry her on from one little
daily doing to another, with calm deliberation, taking them each in turn
without haste or rest, and finding time for them all. Now, the things
that she did not care about she began to do with a rush, so as to get to
her writing. She wanted to be always at that; and the consequence was a
wearing sensation, as of one who is driven to death, and has never time
enough for any single thing.</p>

<p>But it was in these days, nevertheless, that she began to write with
decision. Hitherto, she had been merely trying her pen&mdash;feeling her way;
but now she unconsciously ceased to follow in other people's footsteps,
and struck out for herself boldly. She had come back from Ilverthorpe
with a burning idea to be expressed, and it was for the shortest,
crispest, clearest way to express it that she tried. Foreign phrases she
discarded, and she never attempted to produce an eccentric effect by
galvanising obsolete words, rightly discarded for lack of vitality, into
a ghastly semblance of life. Her own language, strong and pure, she
found a sufficient instrument for her purpose. When the true impulse to
write came, her fine theories about style only hampered her, so she cast
them aside, as habitual affectations are cast aside and natural emotions
naturally expressed, in moments of deep feeling; and from that time
forward she displayed, what had doubtless been coming to her by practice
all along, a method and a manner of her own.</p>

<p>She produced a little book at this time, the first thing of any real
importance she had accomplished as yet; and during the writing of it she
enjoyed an interval of unalloyed happiness, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
 most perfect that she
had ever known. The world without became as nothing to her; it was the
world within that signified. The terrible sense of loneliness, from
which she had always suffered more or less, was suspended, and she began
to wonder how it was she had ever felt so desolate, that often in the
streets of Slane she would have been grateful to anybody who had spoken
to her kindly. Now she said to herself, sincerely, "Never less alone
than when alone!" And up in the quiet of her secret chamber, with the
serene blue above, the green earth and the whispering trees below, and
all her little treasures about her: the books, the pictures, the pretty
hangings, and little ornaments for flowers; things she had indulged in
by degrees since her mother's death had left her with the money in her
hands which she had made to discharge Dan's debt&mdash;up there at her ease
in that peaceful shrine, secure from intrusion, "There is no joy but
calm!" was her constant ejaculation. Then again, too, she felt to
perfection the fine wonder, the fine glow of a great inspiration, and
realised anew that therein all the pleasures of the senses added
together are contained; that inspiration in its higher manifestations is
like love&mdash;that it is love, in fact&mdash;love without the lover; there being
all the joy of love in it, but none of the trouble.</p>

<p>But, like most young writers when they set up a high ideal for
themselves, and are striving conscientiously to arrive at it, because
the thing came easily she fancied she had not done her best, and was
dissatisfied. She talked to herself about fatal facility, without
reflecting that in time ease comes by practice; nor did she discriminate
between the flow of cheap ideas pumped up from any source for the
occasion, which satisfies the conceit of shallow workers, and the deep
stream that bubbles up of itself when it is once released, and flows
freely from the convictions, the observations, and the knowledge of an
earnest thinker. Diffidence is a help to some, but to Beth it was a
hindrance, a source of weakness. There was no fear of her taking herself
for a heaven-born genius. Her trouble had always been her doubt of the
merit of anything she did. She should have been encouraged, but instead
she had always been repressed. Accordingly, when she had finished her
little masterpiece, she put it away with the idea of rewriting it, and
making something of it when she should be able; and then she began a
much more pretentious work, and thought it must be better because of the
trouble it gave her.</p>

<p>Gradually, from now, she gave up all her time to reading and writing,
and she overdid it. Work in excess is as much a vice as idleness, and it
was particularly bad for Beth, whose constitution had begun to be
undermined by dutiful submission. The consulting rooms of specialists
are full of such cases. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
 marriages which for the ignorant girl
preached into dutiful submission, whose "innocence" has been carefully
preserved for the purpose, mean prostitution as absolute, as repugnant,
as cruel, and as contrary to nature as that of the streets. Beth's
marriage was one of those. Until she went to Ilverthorpe, she had never
heard that there was a duty she owed to herself as well as to her
husband; and, as Sir George Galbraith had said, her brain was too
delicately poised for the life she had been leading. Work had been her
opiate; but unfortunately she did not understand the symptoms which
should have warned her that she was overdoing it, and her nerves became
exceedingly irritable. Noises which she had never noticed in her life
before began to worry her to death. Very often, when she was spoken to,
she could hardly answer civilly. At meals everything that was handed to
her was just the very thing she did not want. She quarrelled with all
her food, drank quantities of strong coffee for the sake of the
momentary exhilaration, and even tried wine; but as it only made her
feel worse, she gave that up. Writing became a rage with her, and the
more she had to force herself, the longer she sat at it. She would spend
hours over one sentence, turning it and twisting it, and never be
satisfied; and when she was at last obliged to stop and go downstairs
lest she should be missed, she went with her brain congested, and her
complexion, which was naturally pale and transparent, all flushed or
blotched with streaks of crimson.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your face?" Dan said to her one day, apt, as
usual, to comment offensively on anything wrong.</p>

<p>"I should like you to tell me," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"You'd better take some citrate of iron and quinine."</p>

<p>"You've prescribed citrate of iron and quinine for everything I've ever
had since I knew you," said Beth. "If I have any more of it, I shall be
like the man in the quack advertisement, who felt he could
conscientiously recommend a tonic because he had taken it for fourteen
years. I should like something that would act a little quicker."</p>

<p>Dan left the room and banged the door.</p>

<p>That afternoon Beth, up in her shrine at work, suddenly began to wonder
what he was doing. As a rule, she did not trouble herself about his
pursuits, but now all at once she became anxious. The thought of all the
unholy places that he might be at (and the unfortunate girl knew all
about all of them, for there was no horror of life with which her
husband had not made her acquainted), filled her with dread&mdash;with a
sensation entirely new to her, and absolutely foreign to her normal
nature. Her feeling for Dan and Bertha, when she discovered their
treachery, had been one of contempt. Their disloyalty, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span> the petty
mean deceits which it entailed, made it difficult to tolerate their
presence, and she was always glad to get rid of them, wherever they
might go. Now, however, she was seized upon with a kind of rage at the
recollection of their intrigue, of the scene in the garden, the glances
she had intercepted, their stolen interviews, clandestine
correspondence, and impudent security. It was all retrospective this
feeling, but the torment of it was none the less acute for that. She
recalled the scene in the garden, and her heart throbbed with anger. She
regretted her own temperate conduct, and imagined herself stealing out
upon them, standing before them, and pouring forth floods of invective
till they cowered. She wished she had refused to let Bertha enter the
house again, and had threatened to expose Dan if he did not meekly
submit to her dictation. She ought to have exposed him too. She should
have gone to Bertha's mother. But where was Dan at that moment? She
jumped up, rushed down to her room, put on her outdoor things in hot
haste, and ran downstairs determined to go and see; but as she entered
the hall at one end of it, Dan himself came in by the hall-door at the
other. The relief was extraordinary.</p>

<p>"Hallo! where are you off to?" he said.</p>

<p>"Just going for a little walk," she answered, speaking ungraciously and
without looking at him. Now that she saw him, her ordinary feeling for
him returned; but instead of being quiet and indifferent as usual, she
found herself showing in her manner something of the contempt she felt,
and it pleased her to do it. She was glad to go out, and be in the open
air away from him; but she had not gone far before the torment in her
mind began again. Why had he come in so unusually early? Was there
anything going on in the house? He was always very familiar with the
servants.</p>

<p>She stopped short at this, turned back, and went in as hurriedly as she
had gone out. In the hall she stood a moment listening. The house seemed
unusually quiet. A green baize door separated the kitchen and offices
from the hall. She opened it, and saw Minna in the butler's pantry,
cleaning the plate. Minna was parlour-maid now, a housemaid having been
added to the establishment when Miss Petterick came, so that that young
lady might be well waited on.</p>

<p>"I think we should give the girl full value for her money, you know,
even if we do without something ourselves," Dan had said, in the
generous thoughtful way that had so often imposed upon Beth.</p>

<p>Beth asked Minna where Drew, the housemaid, was.</p>

<p>"It's her afternoon out, ma'am," Minna answered.</p>

<p>"So it is," said Beth. "I had forgotten."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you want anything, ma'am?" Minna asked. "You're looking poorly.
Would you like a cup o' tea?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Beth rejoined, then changed her mind. "Yes, I should,
though. Get me one while I'm taking my things off, and bring it to me in
the dining-room. Where is your master?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am. I've not heard if he's come in; but it's full
early for him yet," Minna replied, as she took off her working apron.</p>

<p>While she was talking to the girl, the worry in Beth's head stopped, and
she felt as usual. Going quietly upstairs, she fancied she heard some
one moving in her bedroom, and, entering it by way of the dressing-room,
she discovered Dan on his knees on the floor, prying into one of the
boxes she had had with her at Ilverthorpe, and kept locked until she
should feel inclined to unpack it. He seemed to have had all the
contents out, and was just deftly repacking it. As he replaced the
dresses, he felt in the pocket of each, and in one he found an old
letter which he read.</p>

<p>Beth withdrew on tiptoe, and went downstairs again, wondering at the
man. She took off her hat and jacket, and ensconced herself with the
newspaper in an easy-chair. Minna came presently with fragrant tea and
hot buttered toast, and talked cheerfully about some of her own
interests. Beth treated her servants like human beings, and rarely had
any trouble with them. She had learnt the art from Harriet, who had
awakened her sympathies, and taught her practically, when she was a
child, what servants have to suffer; and "well loved and well served"
exactly described what Beth was as a mistress. When Minna withdrew, and
Beth had had her tea and toast, she felt quite right again, and read the
paper with interest. The shock of the real trouble had ousted the
imaginary one for the moment.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, as she toiled with flushed face and weary
brain, stultifying her work with painful elaboration, she was seized
with another fit of jealous rage, just as she had been the day before.
Her mind in a moment, like a calm sea caught by a sudden tempest,
seethed with horrible suspicions of her husband. His gross ideas,
expressed in coarse language, had hitherto been banished from her mind
by her natural refinement; but now, like the works of a disordered
machine, whirling with irresponsible force, thoughts suggested by him
came crowding in the language he habitually used, and she found herself
accusing him with conviction of all she had ever heard others accused of
by him. For a little she pursued this turn of thought, then all at once
she jumped up and rushed downstairs, goaded again to act&mdash;to avenge
herself&mdash;to dog him down to one of his haunts, and there confront him,
revile him, expose him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a tranquil grey day in early autumn, the kind of day, full of
quiet charm, which had always been grateful to Beth; but now, as she
stood on the doorstep, with wrinkled forehead, dilated eyes, and
compressed lips, putting her gloves on in feverish haste, she felt no
tranquillising charm, and saw no beauty in the tangled hedgerows bright
with briony berries, the tinted beeches, the Canadian poplars whispering
mysteriously by the watercourse at the end of the meadow, the glossy
iridescent plumes of the rooks that passed in little parties silhouetted
darkly bright against the empty sky; it was all without significance to
her; her further faculty was suspended, and even the recollection of
anything she had been wont to feel had lapsed, and she perceived no more
in the scene surrounding, in the colours and forms of things, the sounds
and motions, than those perceive whose eyes have never been opened to
anything beyond what appears to the grazing cattle. In many a heavy hour
she had found delight in nature; but now, again, she had lost that
solace; the glory had departed, and she had sunk to one of the lowest
depths of human pain.</p>

<p>Not understanding the frightful affliction that had come upon her, she
made no attempt to control her disordered fancy, but hurried off into
the town, and hovered about the places which Dan had pointed out as
being of special evil interest, and searched the streets for him, acting
upon the impulse without a doubt of the propriety of what she was doing.
Had the obsession taken another form, had it seemed right to her to
murder him, the necessity would have been as imperative, and she would
have murdered him, not only without compunction, but with a sense of
satisfaction in the deed.</p>

<p>She pursued her search for hours, but did not find him; then went home,
and there he was, standing on the doorstep, looking out for her.</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been?" he said.</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been yourself?" she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Minding my own business," he answered.</p>

<p>"So have I," she retorted, pushing past him into the hall.</p>

<p>He had never seen her like that before, and he stood looking after her
in perplexity.</p>

<p>She went upstairs and threw herself on her bed. The worry in her head
was awful. Turn and toss as she would, the one idea pursued her, until
at last she groaned aloud, "O God! release me from this dreadful man!"</p>

<p>After a time, being thoroughly exhausted, she dropped into a troubled
sleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke, Dan was standing looking at her.</p>

<p>"Aren't you well, Beth?" he said. "You've been moaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span> and muttering
and carrying on in your sleep as if you'd got fever."</p>

<p>"I don't think I am well," she answered in her natural manner, the
pressure on her brain being easier at the moment of awakening.</p>

<p>He felt her pulse. "You'd better get into bed," he said, "and I'll fetch
you a sedative draught. You'll be all right in the morning."</p>

<p>Beth was only too thankful to get into bed. When he returned with the
draught, she asked him if he were going out again.</p>

<p>"No, not unless I'm sent for," he said. "Where the devil should I be
going to? It's close on dinner-time."</p>

<p>Beth shut her eyes. "If he is sent for and goes," she reflected, "I
shall know it is a ruse to deceive me; and I shall get up and follow
him."</p>

<p>He left her to sleep and went downstairs. But Beth could not sleep. The
draught quieted her mind for a little; then the worry began again as bad
as ever, and she found herself straining her attention to discover to
whom he was talking, for she fancied she heard him whispering with some
one out in the passage. She bore the suspicion awhile, then jumped out
of bed impetuously and opened the door. The gas was burning low in the
passage, but she could see that there was no one about. Surely, though,
there were voices downstairs? Barefooted, and only in her night-dress,
she went to see. Yes, there were voices in the dining-room&mdash;now! She
flung the door wide open. Dan and another man, a crony of his, who had
dropped in casually, were sitting smoking and chatting over their
whiskeys-and-sodas.</p>

<p>Beth, becoming conscious of her night-dress the moment she saw them,
turned and fled back to her bed; greatly relieved in her mind by the
shock of her own indiscretion.</p>

<p>"What a mad thing to do!" she thought. "I hope to goodness they didn't
see me."</p>

<p><i>A mad thing to do!</i></p>

<p>The words, when they recurred to her, were a revelation. What had she
been doing all day? Mad things! What was this sudden haunting horror
that had seized upon her? Why, madness! Dan was just as he had always
been. The change was in herself, and only madness could account for such
a change. There was madness in the family. She remembered her father and
the "moon-faced Bessie"&mdash;the familiarities with servants, too; surely
her mother had suffered, and doubtless this misery which had come upon
her had been communicated to her before her birth. Jealous-mad she was;
that was what it meant, the one idea goading her on to do what would
otherwise have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
 impossible, possessing her in spite of herself, and
not to be banished by any effort of will.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me!" she groaned. "What will become of me?"</p>

<p>Then, as if in reply, there rose to her lips involuntarily the assurance
which recurred to her now for her help and comfort in every hard moment
of her life like a refrain: "I shall succeed."</p>

<p>And she set herself bravely to conceal her trouble, whatever it cost
her, and to conquer it.</p>

<p>But it was a hard battle. For months the awful worry in her head
continued, the same thoughts haunted her, the same jealous rage
possessed her, and she knew no ease except when Dan was at hand. The
trouble always passed when she had him under observation. She could not
read, she could not write, she was too restless to sit and sew for more
than a few moments at a time. Up and down stairs she went, out of the
house and in again, fancying always, when in one place, that she would
be better in another, but finding no peace anywhere, no brightness in
the sunshine, no beauty in nature, no interest in life. Through the long
solitary hours of the long solitary days she fought her affliction with
her mouth set hard in determination to conquer it. She met the
promptings of her disordered fancy with answers from her other self. "He
and Bertha Petterick are together, that is why he is so late," the fiend
would asseverate. "Very likely," her temperate self would reply. "But
they may have been together any day this two years, and I knew it, and
pitied and despised them, but felt no pain; why should I suffer now?
Because my mind is disordered. But I shall recover! I shall succeed!"</p>

<p>She would look at the clock, however, every five minutes in an agony of
suspense until Dan came in. Then she had to fight against the impulse to
question him, which beset her as strongly as the impulse to follow him,
and that was always upon her except when his presence arrested it. Never
once through it all, however, did she think of death as a relief; it was
life she looked to for help, more life and fuller. She could interest
herself in nothing, care for nothing; all feeling of affection for any
one had gone, and was replaced by suspicion and rage. In her torment her
cry was, "Oh, if some one would only care for me! for me as I am with
all my faults! If they would only forgive me my misery and help me to
care again&mdash;help <i>me</i> also to the luxury of loving!"</p>

<p>Forgive her her misery! The world will forgive anything but that; it
tramples on the wretched as the herd turns on a wounded beast, not to
put it out of its pain, but because the sight of suffering is an offence
to it. If we cannot enliven our acquaintances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
 they will do little to
enliven us. Sad faces are shunned; and signs of suffering excite less
sympathy than repulsion. The spirit of Christ the Consoler has been
driven out from among us.</p>

<p>Beth poured herself out in letters at this time rather more than was her
habit; it was an effort to get into touch with the rest of the world
again. In one to Jim, speaking of her hopes of success, she said she
should get on better with her work if she had more sympathy shown her;
to which he replied by jeering at her. What did she mean by such
nonsense? But that was the way with women; they were all sickly
sentimental. Sympathy indeed! She should think herself devilish lucky to
have a good husband and a home of her own. Many a girl would envy her.
He wrote also to other members of the family on the subject, as if it
were a rare joke worth spreading that Beth wanted more sympathy; and
Beth received several letters in which the writers told her what their
opinion was of her and her complaints as compared to that good husband
of hers, who was always so bright and cheery. All their concern was for
the worthy man who had done so much for Beth. They had no patience with
her, could scarcely conceal their amusement with this last absurdity,
but thought she should be laughed out of her fads and fancies. That was
the only time Beth sought sympathy from any of her relations. Afterwards
she took to writing them bitter letters in which she told them what she
thought of them as freely as they told her. "What is the use," she said
to Jim, "what is the use of sisters and wives being refined and virtuous
if their fathers, brothers, husbands, are bar-loafers, men of corrupt
imagination and depraved conversation? Surely, if we must live with such
as these, all that is best in us adds to our misery rather than helps
us. If we did not love the higher life ourselves, it would not hurt us
to be brought into contact with the lower."</p>

<p>On receiving this letter, Jim wrote kindly to Dan, and said many things
about what women were coming to with their ridiculous notions. But men
were men and women were women, and that was all about it,&mdash;a lucid
conclusion that appealed to Dan, who quoted it to Beth in discussions on
the subject ever afterwards.</p>

<p>Beth broke down and despaired many times during the weary struggle with
her mental affliction. She felt herself woefully changed; and not only
had the light gone out of her life, but it seemed as if it never would
return. When she awoke in the morning, she usually felt better for
awhile, but the terrible torment in her mind returned inevitably, and
rest and peace were banished for the day. It was then she learnt what is
meant by the inner calm, and how greatly to be desired it is&mdash;desired
above everything. The power to pray left her entirely during this
phase.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
 She could repeat prayers and extemporise them as of old, but
there was no more satisfaction in the effort than in asking a favour of
an empty room. Sometimes, and especially during the hideous nights, when
she slept but little, and only in short snatches, she felt tempted to
take something, stimulant or sedative; but this temptation she resisted
bravely, and, the whole time, an extra cup of tea or coffee for the sake
of the momentary relief was the only excess she committed. If she had
not exercised her will in this, her case would have been hopeless; but,
as it was, her self-denial, and the effort it entailed, kept up her
mental strength, and helped more than anything to save her.</p>

<p>To beguile the long hours, she often stood in the dining-room window
looking out. The window was rather above the road, so that she looked
down on the people who passed, and she could also see over the hedge on
the opposite side of the road into the meadow beyond. Small things
distracted her sometimes, though nothing pleased her. If two rooks flew
by together, she hoped for a better day; if one came first, she would
not accept the omen, but waited, watching for two. By a curious
coincidence, they generally passed, first one for sorrow, then two for
mirth, then three for a wedding; and she would say to herself, first,
bad luck, then good luck, then a marriage; and wonder how it would come
about, but anyhow&mdash;"I shall succeed!" would flash from her and stimulate
her.</p>

<p>One day, as she stood there watching, she saw a horseman come slowly
down the road.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bowshot from her bower-eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He rode between the barley sheaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sun came dazzling through the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And flamed upon the brazen greaves<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Of bold Sir Launcelot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beth's attention sharpened to sudden interest. As he came abreast of the
window, the rider looked up, and Beth's heart bounded at the sight of
his face, which was the face of a man from out of the long ago, virile,
knightly, high-bred, refined; the face of one that lives for others, and
lives openly. He had glanced up indifferently, but, on seeing Beth, a
look of interest came into his eyes. It was as if he had recognised her;
and she felt herself as if she had seen him before, but when or where,
in what picture, in what dream, she could not tell.</p>

<p>With the first flush of healthy interest she had experienced for a long
time, she watched him till he was all but out of sight, then shut her
eyes that she might not see him vanish, for fear of bad luck; a
superstition she had not practised since she was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>child. When he had
gone, she found herself with a happy impression of him in her mind, an
impression of quiet dignity, and of strength in repose. "A man to be
trusted," she thought; "true and tender, a perfect knight." The flash of
interest or recognition that came into his countenance when he saw her
haunted her; she recalled the colour of his blue eyes, noted the
contrast they were to his dark hair and clear dark skin, and was
pleased. In the afternoon she sat and sewed, and smiled to herself over
her work with an easy mind. Her restlessness had subsided; Dan scarcely
cost her a thought; the tension was released and a reaction had set in;
but, at the time, she herself was quite unaware of it. All she felt was
a good appetite for her tea.</p>

<p>"Minna," she said to the parlour-maid, "bring me a big cup of tea and a
good plate of buttered toast. I'm famishing."</p>

<p>"That's good news, ma'am," Minna answered, for it was long since Beth
had had any appetite at all.</p>

<p>The next day Beth stood at the window again, but without intention. She
was thinking of her knight of the noble mien, however, and at about the
same hour as on the day before, he came again, riding slowly down the
road; and again he looked at Beth with a flash of interest in his face,
to which she involuntarily responded. When he was out of sight she
opened the window, and perceived to her glad surprise that the air was
balmy, and on all things the sun shone, shedding joy.</p>

<p>The horrid spell was broken.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI"></a>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bowshot from her bower-eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He rode between the barley-sheaves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words made music in Beth's heart as she dressed next morning, and,
instead of the torment of mind from which she had suffered for so long,
there was a great glad glow. Dan went and came as usual, but neither his
presence nor absence disturbed her. She had recovered her
self-possession, her own point of view, and he and his habits resumed
their accustomed place in her estimation. During that dreadful phase she
had seen with Dan's suspicious eyes, and seen evil only, but had not
acquired his interest and pleasure in it; on the contrary, her own
tendency to be grieved by it had been intensified. Now, however, she had
recovered herself, her sense of proportion had been restored, and she
balanced the good against the evil once more, and rejoiced to find that
the weight of good was even greater than she had hitherto supposed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>But although the spell had been broken in a moment, her right mind was
not permanently restored all at once. It was only gradually, as the tide
goes out after a tempest, and leaves the storm-beaten coast in peace,
that the worry in her head subsided. She had lapse after lapse. She
would lie awake at night, a prey to horrible thoughts, or start up in
the early morning with her mind all turgid with suspicions which goaded
her to rush out and act, act&mdash;see for herself&mdash;do something. But the
great difference now was that, although she was still seized upon by the
evil, it no longer had the same power to grieve her. She had valiantly
resisted it from the moment she recognised its nature, but now she not
only resisted it, she conquered it, and found relief. When her
imagination insisted on pursuing Dan to his haunts, she deliberately and
successfully turned her attention to other things. She turned her
attention to the friends she loved and trusted, she dwelt on the
kindness they had shown her, she forced herself to sit down and write to
them, and she would rise from this happy task with her reason restored,
the mere expression of affection having sufficed to exorcise the devils
of rage and hate.</p>

<p>But it was the strange exalted sentiment which her knight had inspired
that began, continued, and completed her cure. Day after day he came
riding down the road, riding into her life for a moment, then passing on
and leaving her, not desolate, but greatly elated. She had known no
feeling like this feeling, no hope or faith like the hope and faith
inspired by that man's mien. She did not know his name, she had never
heard his voice; their greeting&mdash;which was hardly a greeting, so
restrained was the glance and the brightening of the countenance which
was all the recognition that passed between them&mdash;was merely momentary,
yet, in that moment, Beth was imbued with joy which lasted longer and
longer each time, until at last it stayed with her for good, restored
the charm of life to her, re-aroused her dormant further faculty, and
quickened the vision and the dream anew. She prayed again in those days
fervently, and in full faith, as of old; for when we pray with love in
our hearts our prayers are granted, and her heart was full of love&mdash;a
holy, impersonal love, such as we feel for some great genius, adored at
a distance, for the grace of goodness he has imparted to us. And her
heart being full of love, her brain teemed with ideas; the love she
lived on, the ideas she held in reserve, for she had been so weakened by
all she had suffered that the slightest exertion in the way of work
exhausted her. In any case, however, great ideas must simmer long in the
mind before they come to the boil, and the time was not lost.</p>

<p>In those days fewer people than ever came to the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> For weeks
together Beth never spoke to a soul except the servants and her husband,
and through the long hours when her head troubled her and she could not
work, she felt her isolation extremely. Mrs. Kilroy and her other new
friends sent her pamphlets and papers and hurried notes to keep her
heart up and inform her of their progress, and Beth, knowing what the
hurry of their lives was, and not expecting any attention, was grateful
for all they paid her. She had no fear of losing touch with such friends
after they had once received her into their circle as one of themselves,
however seldom she might see them, and it was well for her mental health
that she had them to rely on during that time of trial, for without them
she would have had no sense of security in any relation in life.</p>

<p>She was gradually growing to be on much more formal terms with Dan than
she had been, thanks to her own strength of character. She found she was
able to reduce the daily jar, and even to keep his coarseness in check,
by extreme politeness. In any difference, his habit had been to try and
shout her down; but the contrast of her own quiet dignified demeanour
checked him in that. Beth had the magnetic quality which, when steadily
directed, acts on people and forces them into any attitude desired; and
Dan accommodated his manner and conversation to her taste more now than
he had ever done before; but he felt the restraint, and was with her as
little as possible, which, as she began to recover, was also a
relief&mdash;for his blatant self-absorption, the everlasting I, I, I, of his
conversation, and his low views of life, rasped her irritable nerves
beyond endurance.</p>

<p>One day, coming into the drawing-room about tea-time, with muddy boots
and his hat on, he found her lying on the sofa, prostrated with nervous
headache. The days closed in early then, and she had had the fire
lighted and the curtains drawn, but could not bear the gaslight because
of her head.</p>

<p>"Well, this isn't brilliant," he began, at the top of his voice. "A
little more light would suit me." He struck a match and turned the gas
full on. "That's better," he said; "and some tea would be refreshing
after my walk. I've done the whole trudge on foot this afternoon, and I
consider that's a credit to me. You won't find many rising young men
economising in the matter of horseflesh as I do, or in anything else.
I'll undertake to say I spend less on myself than any other man in the
diocese." He went to the door instead of ringing the bell, and shouted
down the passage to Minna to bring him some tea.</p>

<p>Beth shut her eyes and groaned inwardly.</p>

<p>When the tea came, Dan poured some out for himself, remarking, "I
suppose you've had yours." Beth had not, but she was beyond making any
effort to help herself at the moment. Dan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
 who always ate at a greedy
rate, left off talking for a little; and during the interval, Beth was
startled by something cold touching her hand. She opened her eyes, and
found a dainty little black-and-tan terrier standing up, with its
forepaws on the couch, looking at her.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty thing," she said. "Where have you come from?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that the dog?" said Dan, looking round to see to whom she was
talking. "He followed me in. I don't know who he belongs to; but as I
happen to want a little dog, he's welcome."</p>

<p>"But he's very well-bred, isn't he," said Beth, "and valuable? Look at
his pencilled paws, and thin tail, and sharp ears pricked to attention.
He's listening to what we are saying with the greatest intelligence. I'm
sure he's a pet, and his owners will want him back."</p>

<p>"Let them come and fetch him, then," said Dan.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to Beth that Dan had probably bought him to present to
somebody, but chose to lie about it for reasons of his own, so she said
no more.</p>

<p>The next night, about ten o'clock, Dan was called out, and did not
return. Beth, being very wideawake, sat up late, playing patience first
of all, and then reading a shilling shocker of Dan's, which she had
taken up casually and become interested in. The story was of an
extremely sensational kind, and she found herself being wrought up by it
to a high pitch of nervous excitement. At the slightest noise she
jumped; and then she became oppressed by the silence, and found herself
peering into the dark corners of the room, and hesitating to glance over
her shoulder, as if she feared to see something. She supposed the
servants had not yet gone to bed, for she heard at intervals what seemed
to be a human voice. After a time, however, it struck her that there was
something unusual in the regularity of the sound, and, although she
continued to read, she found herself waiting involuntarily, with
strained attention, for it to be repeated. When it occurred again, she
thought it sounded suspiciously like a cry of pain; and the next time it
came she was sure of it. Instantly forgetting herself and her nervous
tremors, she threw down her book and went to see what was the matter.
She stood a moment in the hall, where the gas had been left burning, and
listened; but all was still. Then she opened the door of communication
into the kitchen regions, and found that that part of the house was all
in darkness. The servants had gone to bed. Holding the door open, she
stood a little, and listened again; but, as she heard nothing, she began
to think her fancy had played her a trick, when, just beside her, as it
seemed, some one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
 shrieked. Beth, gasping with terror, ran back into the
hall, and struck a match to light one of the bed-candles that stood on a
table, her impulse being to go to the rescue in spite of her deadly
fright. It seemed an age before she could get the candle lit with her
trembling hands, and, in the interval, the horrible cry recurred, and
this time she thought it came from the surgery. Could any sick person
have been left there locked up? Dan always kept the room locked up, and
Beth had hardly ever been in it. She went to the door now, bent on
breaking it open, but she found that for once the key had been left in
the lock. She turned it and entered boldly; but her candle flickered as
she opened the door, so that, at first, she could see nothing
distinctly. She held it high above her head, however, and as the flame
became steady she looked about her. There was no one to be seen. The
room was large and bare. All that it contained was a bookcase, some
shelves with books on them, a writing-table and chair, an arm-chair, a
couch, and another table of common deal, like a kitchen table, on which
was a variety of things&mdash;bottles, books, and instruments apparently&mdash;all
covered up with a calico sheet.</p>

<p>Beth, checked again in her search, was considering what to do next, when
the horrid cry was once more repeated. It seemed to come from under the
calico sheet. Beth lighted the gas, put down her candle, and going to
the table, took the sheet off deliberately, and saw a sight too
sickening for description. The little black-and-tan terrier, the bonny
wee thing which had been so blithe and greeted her so confidently only
the evening before, lay there, fastened into a sort of frame in a
position which alone must have been agonising. But that was not all.</p>

<p>Beth had heard of these horrors before, but little suspected that they
were carried on under that very roof. She had turned sick at the sight,
a low cry escaped her, and her great compassionate heart swelled with
rage; but she acted without hesitation.</p>

<p>Snatching up her candle, she went to the shelves where the bottles were,
looked along the row of red labels, found what she wanted, went back to
the table, and poured some drops down the poor little tortured
creature's throat.</p>

<p>In a moment its sufferings ceased.</p>

<p>Then Beth covered the table with the calico sheet mechanically, put the
bottle back in its place, turned out the gas, and left the room, locking
the door after her. Her eyes were haggard and her teeth were clenched,
but she felt the stronger for a brave determination, and more herself
than she had done for many months.</p>

<p>Maclure only came in to bathe and breakfast next morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> and she
scarcely exchanged a word with him before he went out again; but in the
afternoon he came into the drawing-room, where she was writing a letter,
and began to talk as if he meant to be sociable. He had his usual air of
having lavished much attention on his personal adornment&mdash;too much for
manliness; and, in spite of the night work, his hair shone as glossy
black, his complexion was as bright and clear, and his general
appearance as fresh and healthy, as care of himself and complete
indifference to other people, except in so far as his own well-being
might be affected by them, could make it. Beth watched him surveying
himself in the glass from different points of view with a complacent
smile, and felt that his physical advantages, and the superabundant
vitality which made the business of living such an easy enjoyable farce
to him, made his inhuman callousness all the more repulsive.</p>

<p>"I should go out if I were you," he said, peering close into the glass
at the corner of his eye, where he fancied he had detected the faint
criss-cross of coming crows' feet "I'd never stay mugging up in the
house, withering. Look at me! I go out in all weathers, and I'll
undertake to say I'm a pretty good specimen both of health and spirits."</p>

<p>It was so unusual for Dan to recommend Beth to do anything for her own
good that she began to wonder what he wanted; she had observed that he
always felt kindly disposed towards people when he was asking a favour
of them.</p>

<p>"And, by-the-bye," he pursued, turning his back to the mirror and
craning his neck to see the set of his coat-tails, "you might do
something for me when you are out. Wilberforce is worrying for his
money. It's damned cheek. I sent him a large order for whisky the other
day to keep him quiet, but it hasn't answered. I wish you would go and
see him&mdash;go with a long face, like a good girl, and tell him I'm only
waiting till I get my own accounts in. Have a little chat with him, you
know, and all that sort of thing&mdash;lay yourself out to please him, in
fact. He's a gentlemanly fellow for a wine-merchant, and has a weakness
for pretty women. If you go, I'll take my dick he'll not trouble us with
a bill for the next six months."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Beth in her quietest way, "that when a husband
asks his wife to make use of her personal appearance or charm of manner
to obtain a favour for him from another man, he is requiring something
of her which is not at all consistent with her self-respect."</p>

<p>Dan stopped short with his hand up to his moustache to twist it, his
bonhomie cast aside in a moment. "Oh, damn your self-respect!" he said
brutally. "Your cursed book-talk is enough to drive a man to the devil.
Anybody but you, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
 your 'views' and 'opinions' and fads and fancies
generally, would be only too glad to oblige a good husband in such a
small matter. And surely to God <i>I</i> know what is consistent with your
self-respect! <i>I</i> should be the last person in the world to allow you to
compromise it! But your eyes will be opened, and the cursed conceit
taken out of you some day, madam, I can tell you! You'll live to regret
the way you've treated me, I promise you!"</p>

<p>"My eyes have been pretty well opened as it is," Beth answered. "You
left the key in the surgery door last night."</p>

<p>"And you went in there <i>spying</i> on me, did you? That was honourable!" he
exclaimed in a voice of scorn.</p>

<p>"I heard the wretched creature you had been vivisecting crying in its
agony, and I thought it was a human being, and went to see," Beth
answered, speaking in the even, dispassionate way which she had found
such an effectual check on Dan's vulgar bluster.</p>

<p>"You killed that dog, then!" he exclaimed, turning on her savagely. "How
dare you?"</p>

<p>Beth rose from the writing-table, and went and stretched herself out on
the sofa, deliberately facing him.</p>

<p>"How dare <i>you</i>?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"How dare I, indeed, in my own house!" he bawled. "Now, look here,
madam, I'm not going to have any of your damned interference, and so I
tell you."</p>

<p>"Please, I am not deaf," she remonstrated gently. "And now, look here,
sir, I am not going to have any of your <i>damnable</i> cruelties going on
under the same roof with me. I have endured your sensuality and your
corrupt conversation weakly, partly because I knew no better, and partly
because I was the only sufferer, as it seemed to me, in the narrow
outlook I had on life until lately; but I know better now. I know that
every woman who submits in such matters is not only a party to her own
degradation, but connives at the degradation of her whole sex. Our
marriage never can be a true marriage, the spiritual, intellectual,
physical union of a man and a woman for the purpose of perfect
companionship. We have none of the higher aspirations in common, we
should be none the happier for tender experiences of parenthood, none
the holier for any joy or sorrow, pain or pleasure, that might come to
us to strengthen and ennoble us if rightly enjoyed or endured. And this,
I think, is not altogether my fault. But however that may be, it is out
of my power to remedy it now. All I can do is to prevent unedifying
scenes between us by showing you such courtesy and consideration as is
possible. On this occasion I will show you courtesy, but the
consideration is due to me. A woman does not marry to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> her heart
wrung, her health destroyed, her life made wretched by anything that is
preventable, and I intend to put a stop to this last discovered hellish
practice of yours. I will not allow it, and if you dare to attempt it
again, I will call in the townsfolk to see you at your brutal work."</p>

<p>She spoke with decision, in the tone of one who has determined on her
plan of action and will fearlessly pursue it. A great gravity settled on
Daniel Maclure. He stood still a little reflecting, then came to the
fire, beside which Beth, who had risen restlessly as she spoke, was now
sitting in an arm-chair. He drew up another chair, and sat down also,
having resolved, in face of the gravity of the situation, to try some of
his old tactics, and some new ones as well. His first pose was to gaze
into the fire ruefully for awhile, and then his fine eyes slowly filled
with tears.</p>

<p>"It must have been a brutal sight," he said at last, "and I can't tell
you how sorry I am you saw it. I don't wonder you're shaken, poor little
girl, and it's natural that the shock should have made you unreasonable
and uncharitable&mdash;unlike yourself, in fact, for I never knew a more
reasonable woman when you are in your right mind, or a more charitable.
I'm not so bad, however, as you think me. I never intended to inflict
suffering on the creature. I didn't know he'd recover. I had given him a
dose of curare."</p>

<p>"The drug that paralyses without deadening the sense of pain," Beth
interposed. "I have heard of the tender mercies of the vivisector. He
saves himself as much as he can in the matter of distracting noises."</p>

<p>Dan had mentioned curare to give a persuasive touch of scientific
accuracy to his explanation, not suspecting that she knew the properties
of the drug, and he was taken aback for a moment; but he craftily
abandoned that point and took up another.</p>

<p>"These experiments must be made, in the interests of suffering humanity,
more's the pity," he said, sighing.</p>

<p>"In the interests of cruel and ambitious scientific men, struggling to
outstrip each other, and make money, and win fame for themselves
regardless of the cost. They were ready enough in old days to vivisect
human beings when it was allowed, and they would do it again if they
dared."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Beth; don't be rabid," said Dan temperately. "Just think
of the sufferings medical men are able to relieve nowadays in
consequence of these researches."</p>

<p>"Good authorities say that nothing useful has been discovered by
vivisection that could not have been discovered without it," Beth
rejoined. "And even if it had been the means of saving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span> human life, that
would not justify your employment of it. There never could be a human
life worth saving at such an expense of suffering to other creatures. It
isn't as if you made an experiment and had done with it either. One
generation after another of you repeats the same experiments to verify
them, to see for yourselves, for practice; and so countless helpless
creatures are being tortured continually by numbers of men who are
degraded and brutalised themselves by their experiments. Had I known you
were a vivisector, I should not only have refused to marry you, I should
have declined to associate with you. To conceal such a thing from the
woman you were about to marry was a cruel injustice&mdash;a fraud."</p>

<p>"I concealed nothing from you that you were old enough to understand and
take a right view of," Dan protested.</p>

<p>"According to custom," said Beth. "Anything that might prevent a woman
accepting a man is carefully concealed from her. That kind of cant is
wearisome. You did not think me too young to put at the head of a house,
or to run the risk of becoming a mother, although I have heard you
dilate yourself on the horrors of premature motherhood. But that is the
way with men. For anything that suits their own convenience they are
ingenious in finding excuses. As a rule, they see but one side of a
social question, and that is their own. I cannot understand any but
unsexed women associating with vivisectors. Don't pretend you pursue
such experiments reluctantly&mdash;you delight in them. But, whatever the
excuse for them, I am sure that the time is coming when the vivisector
will be treated like the people who prepared the dead for embalming in
ancient Egypt. You will be called in when there is no help for it; but,
your task accomplished, you will be driven out of all decent society, to
consort with the hangman&mdash;if even he will associate with you."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Dan ejaculated, gazing into the fire sorrowfully. "But I
suppose this is what we should expect. It's the way of the world. A
scientific man who devotes all his time and talents to relieving his
fellow-creatures must expect to be misunderstood and reviled by way of
reward. You send for us when you want us&mdash;there's nobody like the doctor
then; but you'll grudge every penny you've got to give us, and you'd not
pay at all if you could help it. I should know."</p>

<p>"I was not speaking of doctors," Beth rejoined. "I was speaking of
vivisectors. But after all, what is the great outcome of your
extraordinary science? What do you do with it? Keep multitudes alive and
suffering who would be happily dead and at rest but for you! If you
practised with the honest intention of doing as much good as you could,
you would not be content merely to treat effects as you do for the most
part; you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
 strike at causes also; and we should hear more of
prevention and less of wonderful cures. You dazzle the blockhead public
with a showy operation, and no one thinks of asking why it is that the
necessity for this same operation recurs so often. You know, probably,
but you disclaim responsibility in the matter. It is not your place to
teach the public, you modestly protest."</p>

<p>"I don't know how you can say that in the face of the effort we have
made to stamp out disease. Why, look at zymotic diseases alone!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Beth answered. "Zymotic diseases alone! But why draw the line
there? And what are you doing to improve the race, to strengthen its
power to resist disease? You talk about Nature when it suits you; but it
is the cant of the subject you employ, for you are at variance with
Nature. Your whole endeavour is to thwart her. Nature decrees the
survival of the fittest; you exercise your skill to preserve the
unfittest, and stop there&mdash;at the beginning of your responsibilities, as
it seems to me. Let the unfit who are with us live, and save them from
suffering when you can, by all means; but take pains to prevent the
appearance of any more of them. By the reproduction of the unfit, the
strength, the beauty, the morality of the race is undermined, and with
them its best chances of happiness. Yes, you certainly do your best to
stamp out measles, smallpox, scarlet fever, and all that group&mdash;diseases
that do not necessarily leave any permanent mark on the constitution;
but at the same time you connive at the spread of the worst disease to
which we are liable. About that you preserve the strictest professional
secrecy. Only to-day, in the <i>Times</i>, there is the report of a
discussion on the subject at a meeting of the International Congress of
Legal Medicine&mdash;where is it?" She took up the paper and read:&mdash;"'There
was an important debate on the spread of an infamous disease by wet
nurses. This question is all the more urgent because, though the
greatest dangers and complications are involved, <i>it is very generally
neglected</i>.... When a doctor knows that the parents of a child are
tainted, should he so far disregard the professional secrecy to which he
is bound as to warn the nurse of her danger in suckling the child?'
Apparently not! The poor woman must take her chance, as the child's
unfortunate mother had to do when she married."</p>

<p>"Ah, now you see for yourself, and will become reasonable, it is to be
hoped," he interrupted, rubbing his hands complacently; "for it is
precisely in order to check that particular disease that appointments
like mine are made."</p>

<p>"It is precisely in order to make vice safe for men that such
appointments are made," she answered. "Medical etiquette would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span> not stop
where it does, at the degradation of those unfortunate women, if you
were honestly attempting to put a stop to that disease. You would have
it reported, irrespective of the sex of the sufferer, like any other
disease that is dangerous to the health of the community. It is not
contrary to etiquette to break your peculiar professional secrecy in the
case of a woman, but it would be in the case of a man; so you punish the
women, and let the men go free to spread the evil from one generation to
another as they like. O justice! O consistency! I don't wonder we have
been shunned since we came to Slane. A man in your position is a mere
pander, and right glad am I of what I have suffered from the scorn and
contempt of the people who would not associate with us. It shows that
the right spirit is abroad in the community."</p>

<p>"Pander!" Dan ejaculated. "I am sorry to hear you use such a word,
Beth."</p>

<p>"It is the right word, unfortunately," she answered.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to know anything about these things," the chaste Daniel
observed, with an air of offended delicacy. "Women can't know enough to
see the matter from the right point of view, and so they make mischief."</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't appreciate that women have grown out of their
intellectual infancy," Beth said, "and have opinions and a point of view
of their own in social matters, especially where their own sex is
concerned. You are still in the days of old Chavasse, who expatiates in
his 'Advice to a Wife' on the dangers of men marrying unhealthy women,
but says not a word of warning to women on the risk of marrying
unhealthy men. You would keep us blindfolded as we were in his day, and
abandon us to our fate in like manner; but it can't be done any more, my
friend. You can hide nothing from sensible women now that concerns the
good of the community. We know there is no protection for women against
this infamous disease, and no punishment for the men who spread it; and
we consider the fact a disgrace to every medical man alive."</p>

<p>"You have a nice opinion of the men of your husband's profession!" Dan
observed sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I have the highest opinion of medical men&mdash;such medical men as Sir
George Galbraith," she replied. "I have seen something of their
high-mindedness, their courage, their devotion, and their genuine
disinterestedness; and I feel sure that in time their efforts will
leaven the whole mass of callousness and cruelty against which they have
to contend in their profession. The hope of humanity is in the doctors,
and they will not fail us. Like Christ, they will teach as well as
heal."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Dan. "As I've told you before, it isn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span> our business to
mind the morals of the people. It's for the parsons to fight the devil."</p>

<p>"But," said Beth, "as I answered you before, you cannot attend to the
health of the community properly without also minding its morals. The
real old devil is disease."</p>

<p>Dan left his seat and walked to the window, where he stood with his
hands in his pockets, looking out for awhile.</p>

<p>"Well, this is enough jawbation for one day, I hope," he said at last,
turning round. "Marrying a woman like you is enough to drive a man to
the devil. I've a jolly good mind to go and get drunk. I declare to God
if I could get drunk overnight and feel all right again in the morning,
I'd be drunk every night. But it can't be done," he added regretfully.
"There are drawbacks to everything."</p>

<p>Beth looked at him imperturbably while he was speaking, then turned her
attention to the fire.</p>

<p>"You know my views now on the subject of vivisection," she said at last.
"If there is any more of it here, I shall leave the house, and publish
the reason. And you also know what I consider I owe myself in the way of
self-respect. You must beguile your creditors by other means than my
personal appearance."</p>

<p>She had spoken all through in the most temperate tone, and now, when she
had finished, she leaned back in her chair and folded her hands with a
sigh, as of one who had finished a hard task and would rest.</p>

<p>Dan looked at her with evident distaste, and considered a little,
searching for something more to say that might move her, some argument
that should persuade or convince; but, as nothing occurred to him, he
left the room, banging the door after him in his ill-conditioned way,
because he knew that the noise would be a racking offence to her
overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>But from that time forward everything he did was an offence to Beth, a
source of irritation. In spite of herself, she detected all the
insincerity of his professions, the mean motives of his acts. Up to this
time she had been more kindly disposed towards him than she herself
knew. All she had wanted was to be able to care for him, to find some
consistency in him, something to respect, and to which she could pin her
faith; but now she knew him for what he was exactly&mdash;shallow,
pretentious, plausible, vulgar-minded, without principle; a man of false
pretensions and vain professions; utterly untrustworthy; saying what
would suit himself at the moment, or just what occurred to him, not what
he thought, but what he imagined he was expected to say. Beth had never
heard him condemn a vice or habit which she did not afterwards find him
practising himself. She used to wonder if he deceived himself, or was
only intent on deceiving her; but from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
 close observation of him at this
period, she became convinced that, for the time being, he entered into
whatever part he was playing, and hence his extreme plausibility. Beth
found herself studying him continually with a curious sort of impersonal
interest; he was a subject that repelled her, but from which,
nevertheless, she could not tear herself away. His hands in particular,
his handsome white hands, had a horrid sort of fascination for her. She
had admired them while she thought of them as the healing hands of the
physician, bringing hope and health; but now she knew them to be the
cruel hands of the vivisector, associated with torture, from which
humanity instinctively shrinks; and when he touched her, her delicate
skin crisped with a shudder. She used to wonder how he could eat with
hands so polluted, and once, at dessert, when he handed her a piece of
orange in his fingers, she was obliged to leave it on her plate, she
could not swallow it.</p>

<p>After that last scene the days dragged more intolerably than ever; but
happily for Beth there were not many more of them without a break, for
just as it seemed that endurance must end in some desperate act, Mrs.
Kilroy sent her a pressing invitation to go and pay her a long visit in
London; and Beth accepted it, and went with such a sense of relief as an
invalid feels who, after long suffering, finds herself well, and out in
the free fresh air once more.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII"></a>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Beth went to stay with the Kilroys in London, it was a question
whether she might not end by joining the valiant army of those who are
in opposition to everything; but before she had been there a week, she
had practically recovered her balance, and began to look out upon life
once more with dispassionate attention. Her depression when she first
arrived was evident, and the Kilroys were concerned to see her looking
so thin and ill; but, by degrees, she expanded in that genial
atmosphere, and although she said little as a rule, she had begun to
listen and to observe again with her usual vivid interest. She could not
have been better situated for the purpose, for people of all kinds came
to the Kilroys; and in moving among them merely as an onlooker, she was
bound to see and hear enough to take her out of herself. Her own
personality was too distinct, however, for her to remain for long an
onlooker merely. That mesmeric quality in her which, whether it
fascinates or displeases, attracts or repels, marks a distinct
personality which is not to be overlooked, made people ask at once who
she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
 was, in the hope that her acquaintance might be worth cultivating.
For there was a certain air of distinction about her which made her look
like a person with some sort of prestige, whom it might be useful to
know&mdash;don't you know.</p>

<p>One afternoon soon after Beth's arrival, Mrs. Kilroy being at home to
visitors, and the rooms already pretty full, Beth noticed among the
callers an old-looking young man whose face seemed familiar to her. He
wore a pointed beard upon his chin, and a small moustache cut away from
his upper lip, and waxed and turned up at the ends. His face was thin
and narrow, his forehead high and bald; what hair he had grew in a
fringe at the back of his head, and was curly, and of a nondescript
brown colour. Had he worn the dress of the Elizabethan period, he might
have passed for a bad attempt to look like Shakespeare; and Beth thought
that that perhaps might be the resemblance which puzzled her. While she
was looking at him a lady was announced, a most demure-looking little
person in a grey costume, and a small, close-fitting princess bonnet,
tied under her chin, and trimmed with a big Alsatian bow in front. She
entered smiling slightly, and she continued to smile, as if she had set
the smile on her lips as she put the bonnet on her head, to complete her
costume. After she had shaken hands with Angelica, she looked round as
if in search of some one else, and seemed satisfied when she discovered
the old-looking young man of Shakesperian aspect. He was watching her,
and their eyes met with a momentary significance, but they took no
further notice of each other. Most people would have perceived no more
in the glance than showed on the surface:&mdash;a lady and gentleman who
looked at each other and then looked away, like indifferent
acquaintances or casual strangers; but Beth's infallible intuition
revealed to her an elaborate precaution in this seeming unconcern. It
was clear to her that the two had expected to meet each other there, and
their apparent insensibility to each other's presence was a pose, which,
however, betrayed to her the intimacy it was affected to conceal. She
hated herself for seeing so much, and burned with blame of Dan for
opening her eyes to behold the inward wickedness beneath the
conventional propriety of the outward demeanour; but therein she was
unjust to Dan. He had opened her eyes sooner than they should have been
opened, but in any case she must have seen for herself eventually.
Nothing in life can be concealed from such a mind. What books could not
teach her, she discovered from people by sympathy, by insight, by
intuition; but she did not come into full possession of her faculties
all at once. The conditions of her life had tended rather to retard than
to develop the best that was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
her, and the wonder was that her vision
had not been permanently distorted, so that she could see nothing but
evil in all things&mdash;see it, too, till her eyes were accustomed and her
soul corrupted, so that she not only ceased to resent it, but finally
accepted it as the inevitable order to which it is best to accommodate
oneself if one is to get any good out of life. This is the fate of most
young wives situated as Beth had been, the fate she had only narrowly
escaped by help of the strength that came of the brave self-contained
habits she had cultivated in her life of seclusion and thought. It was
the result of this training, and her constancy in pursuing it, that her
further faculty, hitherto so fitful, at last shot up a bright and steady
light which made manifest to her the thoughts of others that they were
not all evil, and helped her by the grace in her own heart to perceive
hidden processes of love at work in other hearts, all tending to
purification, and by the goodness of her own soul to search out the
goodness in other souls as the elements find their constituent parts in
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Beth was looking her best that afternoon, although she had taken no
pains with herself. She seemed well dressed by dint of looking well in
her clothes; but she had not chosen to make herself look well. In the
exasperated phase of revolt through which she was passing, she could not
have been persuaded to dress so as to heighten the effect of her
appearance, and so make of herself a trap to catch admiring glances. To
be neat and fresh was all her care; but that was enough. The young man
with the pointed beard, who had been looking about the room uneasily,
seemed to have found what he wanted when he noticed her. He asked an
elderly man standing near him who the young lady of distinguished
appearance might be. "A friend of Mrs. Kilroy's, I believe," the
gentleman answered, and moved off as if he resented the question.</p>

<p>But Pointed Beard was persistent. He asked two or three other people,
strangers, who did not know either, and then he made his way to Mrs.
Kilroy, but she was so surrounded he could not get near her. At last he
bethought him of the servants who were handing tea about, and learnt
Beth's name from one of them.</p>

<p>When Beth next noticed him, he was making his way towards her with a cup
of tea in one hand and a plate of cakes in the other.</p>

<p>"I have ventured to bring you some tea," he said, "but I do not know if
it is as you like it. I can easily get you some more, however, if it is
not."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I do not want any," Beth answered somewhat coldly.</p>

<p>"I'll put it here, then, on this console," he rejoined. "If I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> move away
I shall not be able to get near you again in this crowd. I wonder why
Mrs. Kilroy has so many people. Now, <i>I</i> like just a few, eight or ten
for a dinner, you know, and twenty or so on these sort of occasions. And
they must all be interesting people, worth talking to. I am exceedingly
fastidious about the kind of people I know. Even as a boy I was
fastidious."</p>

<p>As he uttered that last sentence, Beth was again aware of something
familiar in his appearance, and she felt sure she had heard him make
that same remark more than once before&mdash;but when? but where?</p>

<p>"That is Lord Fitzkillingham," he continued, "that tall man who has just
come in&mdash;see, there!&mdash;shaking hands with Mrs. Kilroy. He looks like a
duke, don't you know. I admire people of distinguished appearance much
more than good-looking people&mdash;people who are merely good-looking, I
mean, of course. I saw <i>you</i> directly I came into the room, and was
determined to find out who you were; and I asked I can't tell you how
many people, whether I knew them or not. What do you think of that for
perseverance?"</p>

<p>"You certainly seem to be persistent," Beth answered with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm nothing if not persistent," he rejoined complacently. "I'll
undertake to find out anything I want to know. Do you see that lady
there in black? I wanted to know her age, so I went to Somerset House
and looked it up."</p>

<p>"What did you do that for?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"I wanted to know."</p>

<p>"But did she want you to know?"</p>

<p>"Well, naturally not, or she would have told me. But it is no use trying
to conceal things from me. I am not to be deceived."</p>

<p>"You must be quite a loss to Scotland Yard," Beth ventured. "You would
have been admirably fitted for that&mdash;er&mdash;delicate kind of work."</p>

<p>"Well, I think I should," he rejoined. "You see I found <i>you</i> out, and
it was not so easy, for&mdash;er&mdash;no one seemed to know you. However, that
does not matter. We'll soon introduce you."</p>

<p>Beth smiled. "Thank you," she said drily, "that will be very nice."</p>

<p>"I'll bring Fitzkillingham presently; he'll do anything for me. He was
one of our set at the 'Varsity. That's the best of going to the
'Varsity. You meet the right kind of people there, people who can help
you, you know, if you can get in with them as I did. You'll like
Fitzkillingham. He's a very good fellow."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Beth. "What has he done?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<p>"Done!" he echoed. "Oh, nothing that I know of. Consider his position!
The Earl of Fitzkillingham, with a rent-roll of fifty thousand a year,
has no need to do; he has only to be. There, he's caught my eye. I'll go
and fetch him."</p>

<p>"Pray do nothing of the kind," said Beth emphatically. "I have no wish
to know him."</p>

<p>The young man, disconcerted, turned and looked her full in the face.
"Why not?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"First of all, because you were going to present him without asking my
permission," Beth said, "which is a liberty I should have had to resent
in any case by refusing to know him; and secondly, because a man worth
fifty thousand a year who has done no good in the world is not worth
knowing. I don't think he should be allowed to <i>be</i> unless he can be
made to <i>do</i>. Pray excuse me if I shock your prejudices," she added,
smiling. "You do not know, perhaps, that in <i>our</i> set, knowing people
for position rather than for character is quite out of date?"</p>

<p>The young man smiled superciliously. "That is rather a bourgeois
sentiment, is it not?" he said.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said Beth, "it is the other that is the huckster
spirit. What is called knowing the right people is only the commercial
principle of seeking some advantage. Certain people make a man's
acquaintance, and pay him flattering attentions, not because their
hearts are good and they wish to give him pleasure, but because there is
some percentage of advantage to be gained by knowing him. That is to be
bourgeois in the vulgar sense, if you like! And that is the trade-mark
stamped upon most of us&mdash;selfishness! snobbishness! One sees it in the
conventional society manners, which are superficially veneered,
fundamentally bad; the outcome of self-interest, not of good feeling;
one knows exactly how, where, and when they will break down."</p>

<p>"What are you holding forth about, Beth?" said Mrs. Kilroy, coming up
behind her.</p>

<p>"The best people," Beth answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"You mean the people who call themselves the best people&mdash;Society, that
is to say," said Mrs. Kilroy cheerfully. "Society is the scum that comes
to the surface because of its lightness, and does not count, except in
sets where ladies' papers circulate."</p>

<p>"I am surprised to hear <i>you</i> talk so, Mrs. Kilroy," said Pointed Beard
in an offended tone, as if society had been insulted in his person.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I disappoint you," said Mrs. Kilroy. "And I confess I
like my own set and their pretty manners; but I know their weaknesses.
There is no snob so snobbish as a snob of good birth. The upper classes
will be the last to learn that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
 it is sterling qualities which are
wanted to rule the world,&mdash;head and heart."</p>

<p>"This gentleman will tell you that all that is bourgeois," said Beth.</p>

<p>"I believe that at heart the bourgeois are sound," said Angelica.
"Bourgeois signifies good, sound, self-respecting qualities to me, and
steady principles."</p>

<p>"But scarcely 'pretty manners,' I should suppose," said Pointed Beard
superciliously.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Angelica. "Sincerity and refinement make good manners,
and principle is the parent of both."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that for the most part Englishwomen are singularly
lacking in charms of manner?" he asked precisely.</p>

<p>"Just as Englishmen are, and for the same reason," said Angelica;
"because they only try to be agreeable when it suits themselves. A good
manner is a decoration that must be kept on always if it is to be worn
with ease. Good manners are rare because good feeling is rare, for good
manners are the outcome of good feeling. Manners are not the mere
society show of politeness, but the inward kindly sympathy of which
politeness is the natural outward manifestation; given these, grace and
charm of manner come of themselves."</p>

<p>She moved off as she spoke to attend to other guests.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kilroy is obvious," said Pointed Beard, in a tone that suggested
sympathy with Beth for being bored. "I wonder she did not give us 'For
manners are not idle,' et cetera, or something equally banal&mdash;the kind
of thing we are taught in our infancy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And fail to apply ever after," said Beth.</p>

<p>"I see you are ready," he observed fatuously, striking the personal note
again, which she resented.</p>

<p>"I dislike that cant of the obvious which there is so much of here in
town," she rejoined. "It savours of preciosity. All that is finest in
thought is obvious. A great truth, well put, when heard for the first
time, is so crystal clear to the mind, one seems to have known it
always. No one fears to be obvious who has anything good to say."</p>

<p>He stroked his beard in silence for some seconds. "I suppose you go in
for politics, and all that sort of thing," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Why?" Beth asked in her disconcerting way.</p>

<p>"Oh, judging by your friends."</p>

<p>"Not a safe guide," she assured him. "My friends have the most varied
interests; and even if they had not, it would be somewhat monotonous for
them to associate exclusively with people of the same pursuits."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you do not take an interest in politics?" he jerked out, almost
irritably, as if he had a right to know.</p>

<p>For a moment Beth had a mind to baffle him for his tasteless
persistency, but her natural directness saved her from such
small-mindedness. "If I must answer your catechism," she said, smiling,
"social subjects interest me more. I find generalisations bald and
misleading, and politics are a generalisation of events. I rarely read a
political speech through, and remember very little of what it is all
about when I do. Details, individuals, and actions fascinate me, but the
circumstances of a people as a state rarely interest me much."</p>

<p>"Ah, I fear that is&mdash;er&mdash;a feminine point of view, rather&mdash;is it not?"
he rejoined patronisingly.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and a scientific method. We go from the particular to
the general, and only draw broad conclusions when we have collected our
facts in detail. But excuse me, I see a friend," she broke off hastily,
seizing the chance to escape.</p>

<p>A little later Beth saw that the demure-looking little person in the
princess bonnet was taking her leave. She passed down the room with her
set little smile on her lips, looking about her, but apparently without
seeing any one in particular till she got to the door, when her eye
lighted on the young man of Shakesperian mien, and her smile flickered a
moment, and went out. The young man turned and looked at a picture with
an elaborately casual air, then sauntered across the room to Mrs.
Kilroy, shook hands with her, spoke to one or two other people, and
finally reached the door and opened it with the same solemn affectation
of not being in a hurry, and disappeared. Beth wondered if he kept his
caution up before the footmen in the hall, or if he made an undignified
bolt of it the moment he was out of sight of society.</p>

<p>At dinner that evening she asked Mrs. Kilroy who and what that
thin-nosed man, that sort of reminiscence of Shakespeare, was.</p>

<p>"He is by way of being a literary man, I believe," Angelica answered.
"He is not a friend of ours, and I cannot think why he comes here. I
never ask him. He got himself introduced to me somehow, and then came
and called, which I thought an impertinence. Did you notice that woman
with an Alsatian bow in her bonnet, that made her look like a horse with
its ears laid back? Her pose is to improve young men. She improves them
away from their wives, and I object to the method; and I do not ask her
here either. Yet she comes. His wife I have much sympathy with; but he
keeps her in the country, out of the way, so I see very little of her."</p>

<p>"What is his name?" Beth asked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alfred Cayley Pounce."</p>

<p>"Why!" Beth exclaimed. "He must be a youth I knew long ago, when I was a
child. I was sure I had seen him before. But what a falling off! I
wondered if he were an old young man, or a young old man when I first
saw him. He was refined as a boy and had artistic leanings; I should
have thought he might have developed something less banal in the time
than a bald forehead."</p>

<p>"That kind of man spends most of his time in cultivating acquaintances,"
said Mr. Kilroy. "When he hasn't birth, his pose is usually brains. But
Pounce took a fair degree at the University. And he's not such a bad
fellow, really. He's precious, of course, and by way of being
literary&mdash;that is to say, he is literary to the extent of having written
some little things of no consequence, upon which he assumes the right to
give his opinion, with appalling assurance, of the works of other
people, which are of consequence. There is a perfect epidemic of that
kind of assurance among the clever young men of the day, and it's
wrecking half of them. A man who begins by having no doubt of the worth
of his own opinion gets no further for want of room to move in."</p>

<p>Next day Beth was alone in a sunny sitting-room at the back of the
house, looking out into grounds common to the whole square. It was about
tea-time. The windows were wide open, the sunblinds were drawn down
outside, and the warm air, fragrant with mignonette, streamed in over
the window boxes. Angelica had given this room up to Beth, and here she
worked or rested; read, wrote, or reflected, as she felt inclined;
soothed rather than disturbed by the far-off sounds of the city, and
eased in mind by the grace and beauty of her surroundings. For the room
was a work of art in itself, an Adams room, with carved white panels,
framing spaces of rich brocade, delicately tinted, on the walls; with
furniture chosen for comfort as well as elegance, and no more of it than
was absolutely necessary, no crowding of chairs and tables, no
congestion of useless ornaments, no plethora of pictures, putting each
other out&mdash;only two, in fact, one a summer seascape, with tiny waves
bursting on shining sands; the other a corner of a beautiful old garden,
shady with trees, glowing with flowers, whence two young lovers, sitting
on an old stone seat, looked out with dreamy eyes on a bright glimpse,
framed in foliage, of the peaceful country beyond. Angelica had thought
that room out carefully for Beth, every detail being considered, so that
the whole should make for rest and refreshment, and she had succeeded
perfectly. Nothing could have eased Beth's mind of the effect of her
late experiences, or strengthened it again more certainly, than the
harmony, the quiet, and the convenience of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
 everything about her&mdash;books
on the shelves, needlework on the work-table, writing materials in
abundance on the bureau, exquisite forms of flowers, and prevailing
tints of apple-blossom, white, and pink, and green; music when she chose
to play; comfort of couch and chairs when she wished to repose; and,
above all, freedom from intrusion, the right to do as she liked gladly
conceded, the respect which adds to the dignity of self-respect, and
altogether the kind of independence that makes most for pleasure and
peace. Before she had been there three weeks she was happily released
from herself by the recovery of her power to work. She began to revise
the book she had thought so little of when it was first written. She had
brought it to town because it was not very bulky, rather than because
she had any hope of it; but when she took it out and read it here alone
in peace, it seized upon her with power, and, in her surprise, like
Galileo, she exclaimed: "But it does turn round!" The book was already
"radiant with inborn genius," but it still lacked the "acquired art,"
and feeling this, she sat down to it regularly, and rewrote it from
beginning to end, greatly enriching it. She had no amateur impatience to
appear in print and become known; the thought of production induced her
to delay and do her utmost rather than to make indiscreet haste; her
delight was in the doing essentially; she was not one to glory in public
successes, however great, or find anything but a tepid satisfaction
therein compared to the warm delight that came when her thoughts flowed,
and the material world melted out of mind.</p>

<p>She had been busy with her book that afternoon, and very happy, until
tea came. Then, being somewhat tired, she got up from the bureau at
which she worked, and went to the tea-table, leaving her papers all
scattered about; and she was in the act of pouring herself out a cup of
tea, when the door opened, and the footman announced, "Mr. Alfred Cayley
Pounce."</p>

<p>Very much surprised, she put the teapot down deliberately and looked at
him. He held his hat to his breast, and bowed with exaggerated
deference, in an affected, foreign way.</p>

<p>"I insisted on seeing you," he began, as if that were something to boast
of. "Perhaps I ought to apologise."</p>

<p>Beth, not knowing what to say, asked him to sit down. Then there was a
little pause. He looked at the tea-table.</p>

<p>"I see that you do take tea," he observed. "Why did you refuse it when I
offered you some yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am not prepared to give you a reason," Beth answered
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Would it be out of place if I were to ask for some tea?" he said.</p>

<p>Beth silently poured him out a cup, and he got up, took what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> he wanted
in the way of sugar and cream and cake, and sat down again, making
himself very much at home.</p>

<p>"Do take some yourself," he pleaded. "You are making me feel such an
outsider."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Beth, helping herself.</p>

<p>She did not know whether to be annoyed or amused by his assurance. Had
she not known who he was she would certainly have been annoyed; but the
recollection of their days together, when the world was young and life
was all pure poetry, came upon her suddenly as she found something of
the boy in the face and voice of the man before her, making it
impossible for her to treat him as a stranger, and melting her into a
smile.</p>

<p>"Confess that you were surprised to see me," he said.</p>

<p>"I was," she answered.</p>

<p>"And not glad, perhaps," he pursued.</p>

<p>"Surprised means neither glad nor sorry," she observed.</p>

<p>"D'you know, the moment I saw you&mdash;&mdash;" he began sentimentally; "but
never mind that now," he broke off. "Let me give you my reason for
coming, which is also my excuse. I hope you will accept it."</p>

<p>Beth waited quietly.</p>

<p>"I told you I could always find out anything I wanted to know about
anybody," he pursued, "and last night I happened to sit next a lady at a
dinner-party who turned out to be a great friend of yours. I always talk
to strange ladies about what I've been doing; that kind of thing
interests them, you know; and I described the party here yesterday
afternoon, and said I only met one lady in the whole assembly worth
looking at and worth speaking to, and that was Mrs. Maclure, who was
staying in the house. 'Oh, I know her quite well,' the lady said. 'She's
a neighbour of mine at Slane. Her husband is a doctor, but I hear <i>she</i>
is connected with some of the best county people in the north. She's
very clever, I believe, and by way of being literary and all that sort
of thing, don't you know. But I don't think she has any one to advise
her.'"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Beth, enlightened, "I know who my great friend is then&mdash;Mrs.
Carne!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Pounce, "and when I heard you were literary, I felt a
further affinity, for, as I daresay you have heard, I am a literary man
myself."</p>

<p>"Yes; I heard you were 'by way of being literary,' too," Beth rejoined.</p>

<p>"Who told you so?" he demanded quickly, his whole thought instantly
concentrated on the interesting subject when it concerned himself.</p>

<p>"I do not feel at liberty to tell you," she replied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was it Mrs. Kilroy?"</p>

<p>Beth made no sign.</p>

<p>"Was it Mr. Kilroy?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"I have already said that I shall not tell you, Mr. Pounce," she
answered frigidly.</p>

<p>He sat in silence for a little, looking extremely annoyed. Beth, to
relieve the tension, offered him some more tea, which he refused curtly;
but as she only smiled at the discourtesy and helped herself, he saw fit
to change his mind, and then resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>"When Mrs. Carne heard that I was a literary man," he said with
importance, "she begged me to do what I could to help you. She said it
would be a great kindness; so I promised I would, and here I am."</p>

<p>"So it seems," said Beth.</p>

<p>He stared at her. "I mean it," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," Beth answered. "You and Mrs. Carne are extremely
kind."</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all!" he assured her blandly. "To me, at all events, it will
be a great pleasure to help and advise you."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to do it?" Beth asked, relaxing. Such obtuseness was
not to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder at the bureau where her papers were spread.
"I shall get you to let me see some of your work," he said, "and then I
can judge of its worth."</p>

<p>"What have you done yourself?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I write regularly for the <i>Patriarch</i>," he said, with the
complacency of one who thinks that he need say no more. "The editor
himself came to stay with us last week, and that means something. Just
now, however, I am contemplating a work of fiction, an important work,
if I may venture to say so myself. It has been on my mind for years."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Beth. "What is its purpose?"</p>

<p>"Purpose!" he ejaculated. "Had you said pur-port instead of pur-pose, it
would have been a sensible question. It is hardly likely I shall write a
novel with a purpose. I leave that to the ladies."</p>

<p>"I have read somewhere that Milton said the poet's mission was '<i>to
allay the perturbation of the mind and set the affections in right
tune</i>,'&mdash;is not that a purpose?" Beth asked. "And one in our own day has
talked of '<i>that great social duty to impart what we believe and what we
think we have learned. Among the few things of which we can pronounce
ourselves certain is the obligation of inquirers after truth to
communicate what they obtain.</i>'"</p>

<p>"But not in the form of fiction," Alfred Cayley Pounce put in
dogmatically.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet there is always purpose in the best work of the great writers of
fiction," Beth maintained.</p>

<p>Not being able to deny this, he supposed sarcastically that she had read
all the works to which she alluded.</p>

<p>"I see you suspect that I have not," she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>"I suspect you did not find that passage you quoted just now from Milton
in his works," he rejoined.</p>

<p>"I said as much," she reminded him.</p>

<p>"Well, but you ought to know better than to quote an author you have not
read," he informed her.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I should read all a man's works before I presume to
quote a single passage?"</p>

<p>"I do," he replied. "Women never understand thoroughness," he observed,
largely.</p>

<p>"Some of us see a difference between thoroughness and niggling," Beth
answered. "I should say, beware of endless preparation! We have heard of
Mr. Casaubon and <i>The Key to all Mythologies</i>."</p>

<p>"I understand now what your friend Mrs. Carne meant about the manner in
which you take advice," Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce informed her, in a
slightly offended tone.</p>

<p>Beth, wondering inwardly why so many people assume they are competent to
advise, prayed that she herself might always be modest enough to wait at
least until her advice was asked.</p>

<p>"I hope I have not discussed your opinion impolitely," she said. "Pray
excuse me if you think I have."</p>

<p>Mollified, he turned his attention once more to the littered bureau.</p>

<p>"You have a goodly pile of manuscript there," he remarked; "may I ask
what it is?"</p>

<p>"It is a little book into which I am putting all my ignorance," she
said.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not going to be diffident about letting me see it?" he
answered encouragingly. "I could certainly give you some useful hints."</p>

<p>"You are too kind," she said; and he accepted the assertion without a
suspicion of sarcasm. She rose when she had spoken, drew the lid of the
bureau down over her papers, and locked it deliberately; but the
precaution rather flattered him than otherwise.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid," he said. "I promise to be lenient. And if we
are as fast friends when the book appears as I trust we shall be, the
<i>Patriarch</i> itself shall proclaim its merits; if not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose it will discover my faults," Beth put in demurely. "I wonder,
by the way," she added, "who told you you are so much cleverer than I
am?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>But fortunately Mrs. Kilroy came in and interrupted them before he had
had time to grasp the remark, for which Beth, from whom it had slipped
unawares, was devoutly thankful.</p>

<p>When he had gone, she sat and wondered if she had really understood him
aright with regard to the <i>Patriarch</i>. Certainly he had seemed to
threaten her, but it was hard to believe that he had sunk so low as to
be capable of criticising her work, not on its own merits, but with
regard to the terms he should be on with its author. She was too upright
herself, however, to think such dishonest meanness possible, so she put
the suspicion far from her, and tried to find some charitable
explanation of the several signs of paltriness she had already detected,
and to think of him as he had seemed to her in the old days, when she
had endowed him with all the qualities she herself had brought into
their acquaintance to make it pleasant and of good effect.</p>

<p>Beth had taken to rambling about alone in the quiet streets and squares
for exercise; and as she returned a few days later from one of these
rambles, she encountered Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce coming out of a
florist's with a large bouquet of orchids in his hand.</p>

<p>"You see I do not forget you," he said, holding the bouquet out to her.
"Every lady has her flower. These delicate orchids are for you."</p>

<p>But Beth ignored the offering. "You are still fond of flowers then?"
slipped from her.</p>

<p>"We do not leave a taste for flowers behind us with our toys," he
rejoined. "If we like flowers as children, we love them as men. The
taste develops like a talent when we cultivate it. To love flowers with
true appreciation of their affinities in regard to certain persons, is
an endowment, a grace of nature which bespeaks the most absolute
refinement of mind. And what would life be without refinement of mind!"</p>

<p>Beth had walked on, and he was walking beside her.</p>

<p>"And how does the book progress?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It is finished," she answered.</p>

<p>"What! already?" he exclaimed. "Why, it takes <i>me</i> a week to write five
hundred words. But then, of course, my work is highly concentrated. I
have sent home for some of it to show you. You see I am pertinacious. I
said I would help you, and I will. I hope you will live to be glad that
we have met. But you must not write at such a rate. You can only produce
poor thin stuff in that way."</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders, and let him assume what he liked on the
subject.</p>

<p>They walked on a little way in silence, then he began again about the
flowers. "Flowers," he informed her, "were the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span> solace of my
boyhood&mdash;the sole solace, I may say, for I had no friends, no
companions, except a poor little chap, a cripple, on whom I took pity.
My people did not think me strong enough for a public school, so they
sent me to a private tutor, a man of excellent family, Rector of a large
seaside parish in the north. He only took me as a favour; he had no
other pupils. But it was very lonely in that great empty house. And the
seashore, although it filled my mind with poetry, was desolate,
desolate!"</p>

<p>Beth, as she listened to these meanderings of his fancy, and recalled
old Vicar Richardson and the house full of children, thought of Mr.
Pounce's remarks about feminine accuracy.</p>

<p>"But had you no girl-friend?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Only the lady of my dreams," he answered. "There was no <i>other</i> lady I
should have looked at in the place. I was always refined. I met the lady
of my dreams eventually. It was among the mountains of the Tyrol.
Imagine a lordly castle, with drawbridge and moat, portcullis and
pleasaunce, and sauntering in the pleasaunce, among the flowers, a
lady&mdash;dressed in white&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Samite?" Beth ventured, controlling her countenance.</p>

<p>"I cannot recall the texture," he said seriously. "How could one think
of textures at such a moment! That would have been too commercial! All I
noted was the lily whiteness&mdash;and her eyes, dark eyes! All the poetry
and passion of her race shone in them. And on the spot I vowed to win
her. I went back to the 'Varsity, and worked myself into the best set.
Lord Fitzkillingham became, as you know, my most intimate friend. He was
my best man at the wedding."</p>

<p>"Then you married your ideal," said Beth. "You should be very happy."</p>

<p>He sighed. "I would not say a word against her for the world," he
asserted. "When I compare her with other women, I see what a lucky man I
must be thought. But," he sighed again, "I was very young, and youth has
its illusions. As we grow older, mere beauty does not satisfy, mere
cleverness and accomplishments do not satisfy, nor wealth, nor rank. A
man may have all that, and yet may yearn for a certain something which
is not there&mdash;and that something is the one thing needful."</p>

<p>They were opposite to the house by this time, and he looked up at the
windows sentimentally. "Which is yours?" he asked. "I pass by daily and
look up."</p>

<p>They had stopped at the door. "I cannot ask you in," Beth said hastily.
"Please excuse me. This is my time for work."</p>

<p>"Ah, the time and the mood!" he ejaculated. "I know it all so well!
Inspiration! Inspiration comes of congenial conversation, as I hope you
will find. You will take my flowers. I cannot claim to have culled them
for you, but at least I chose them."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>As the door had been opened, and the footman in the hall stood looking
on, Beth thought it better to take the flowers in a casual way as if
they belonged to her. A card tied to the bouquet by a purple ribbon fell
out from among the flowers as she took them. On it was written: "Mrs.
Merton Merivale." Beth held the flowers out to Mr. Pounce, with the card
dangling, and raised her eyebrows interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he began slowly, detaching the card as he spoke to gain time,
and changing countenance somewhat. "I confess some one else had had the
good taste to choose these orchids before I saw them; but I always
insist on having just what <i>I</i> want, so I took them, and suggested that
another bouquet might be made for the lady. I overlooked the card."</p>

<p>Beth bowed and left him without further ceremony.</p>

<p>She tossed the flowers under the table in the hall on her way upstairs,
and never knew what became of them. Later in the day she described her
morning's adventure to Angelica, and asked her if she knew who Mrs.
Merton Merivale was.</p>

<p>"Oh, that woman in the princess bonnet with the big Alsatian bow, you
know," Angelica said. "Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce's sometime intellectual
affinity."</p>

<p>"Poor Alfred! he is too crude!" Beth ejaculated. "How I have outgrown
him!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Ideala called next day, and found Angelica alone. "I hear that Beth is
with you?" she said. "What is she doing?"</p>

<p>"Writing a book."</p>

<p>"What kind of a book?"</p>

<p>"Not a book for babes, I should say," said Angelica. "She does not
pretend to consider the young person in the least. It is for parents and
guardians, she says, not for authors, to see to it that the books the
young person reads are suitable to her age. She thinks it very desirable
for her only to read such as are; but personally she does not see the
sense of writing down to her, or of being at all cramped on her account.
She means to address mature men and women."</p>

<p>"That is brave and good," said Ideala. "What is the subject?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Angelica; "but she is certain to put some of
herself into it."</p>

<p>"If by that you mean some of her personal experiences, I should think
you are wrong," said Ideala. "Genius experiences too acutely to make use
of its own past in that way; it would suffer too much in the
reproduction. And besides, it can make better use and more telling of
what it intuitively knows than of what it has actually seen."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not think you believe that Beth will succeed," said Angelica.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Ideala rejoined, "I expect her success will be
unique; only I don't know if it will be a literary success. Genius is
versatile. But we shall see."</p>

<p>Having finished her book, Beth collected her friends and read it aloud
to them. "I don't know what to think of it," she said. "Advise me. Is it
worth publishing, or had I better put it aside and try again?"</p>

<p>"Publish it, by all means," was the unanimous verdict; and Mr. Kilroy
took the manuscript himself to a publisher of his acquaintance, who read
it and accepted it.</p>

<p>"Oh," Beth exclaimed, when she heard the reader's report, "I do know now
what is meant by all in good time! If I had been able to publish the
first things I wrote, how I should have regretted it now! And I did
think so much of myself at that time, too! You should have heard how I
dogmatised to Sir George Galbraith; and he was so good and kind&mdash;he
never snubbed me. But I believe I am out of the amateur stage now, and
far advanced enough to begin all over again humbly and learn my
profession. But I find my point of view unchanged. Manner has always
been less to me than matter. When I think of all the preventable sin and
misery there is in the world, I pray God give us books of good
intention&mdash;never mind the style! Polished periods put neither heart nor
hope in us; theirs is the polish of steel which we admire for the labour
bestowed upon it, but by which we do not benefit. The inevitable ills of
life strengthen and refine when they are heroically borne; it is the
preventable ones that act on our evil passions, and fill us with rage
and bitterness; and what we want from the written word that reaches all
of us is help and advice, comfort and encouragement. If art interferes
with that, then art had better go. It would not be missed by the
wretched&mdash;the happy we need not consider. I am speaking of art for art's
sake, of course."</p>

<p>"We need not trouble about that," said Ideala. "The works of art for
art's sake, and style for style's sake, end on the shelf much respected,
while their authors end in the asylum, the prison, and the premature
grave. I had a lesson on that subject long ago, which enlarged my mind.
I got among the people who talk of style incessantly, as if style were
everything, till at last I verily believed it was. I began to lose all I
had to express for worry of the way to express it! Then one day a wise
old friend of mine took me into a public library; and we spent a long
time among the books, looking especially at the ones that had been
greatly read, and at the queer marks in them, the emphatic strokes of
approval, the notes of admiration, the ohs! of enthusiasm, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span> ahs! of
agreement. At the end of one volume some one had written: 'This book has
done me good.' It was all very touching to me, very human, very
instructive. I never quite realised before what books might be to
people, how they might help them, comfort them, brighten the time for
them, and fill them with brave and happy thoughts. But we came at last
in our wanderings to one neat shelf of beautiful books, and I began to
look at them. There were no marks in them, no signs of wear and tear.
The shelf was evidently not popular, yet it contained the books that had
been specially recommended to me as best worth reading by my stylist
friends. 'There is style for you!' said my friend. 'Style lasts, you
see. Style is engraved upon stone. All the other books about us wear out
and perish, but here are your stylists still, as fresh as the day they
were bought.' 'Because nobody reads them!' I exclaimed. 'Precisely,' he
said. 'There is no comfort in life in them. They are the mere mechanics
of literature, and nobody cares about them except the mechanicians.'
After that I prayed for notable matter to indite, and tried only for the
most appropriate words in which to express it; and then I arrived. If
you have the matter, the manner will come, as handwriting comes to each
of us; and it will be as good, too, as you are conscientious, and as
beautiful as you are good."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce</span>
 called on Beth continually. He was announced
one day when she was sitting at lunch with the Kilroys.</p>

<p>"Really I do not think I ought to let you be bored by that man," Mr.
Kilroy exclaimed. "I once had ten minutes of the academic platitudes of
Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce, and that was enough to last me my life. You
are too good-natured to see him so often. It is a weakness of yours, I
believe, to suffer yourself rather than hurt other people's feelings,
however much they may deserve it. But really you must snub him. There is
nothing else for it. Send out and say you are engaged."</p>

<p>"If I do, he will wait until I am disengaged, or call again, or write in
an offended tone to ask <i>when</i> I can be so good as to make it convenient
to see him!" Beth answered in comical despair.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he bores her a bit at <i>present</i>," Angelica observed.
"He is merely an intellectual exercise for Beth. She watches the
workings of his mind quite dispassionately, draws him out with little
airs and graces, and then adjusts him under the microscope. It interests
her to dissect the creature. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
 she has studied him thoroughly, she
will cast him out, as a worthless specimen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope that isn't true," said Beth, with a twinge of conscience. "I
own it has interested me to see what he has developed into; but surely
that isn't unfair?" She looked at Mr. Kilroy deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"It is vivisection," said Angelica.</p>

<p>"But under such agreeable an&aelig;sthetics that I should think he enjoys it,"
said Mr. Kilroy. "I should have no objection myself."</p>

<p>"Daddy, be careful!" Angelica cried. "A rare specimen like you is never
safe when unscrupulous naturalists are about."</p>

<p>"But no microscope is needed to demonstrate Mr. Kilroy's position in the
scale of being," Beth put in. "It is writ large all over him."</p>

<p>"Good and true, Beth!" said Angelica, smiling. "You can go and gloat
over your worthless specimen as a reward, if you like. But the
scientific mind is a mystery to me, and I shall never understand how you
have the patience to do it."</p>

<p>Beth found Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce pacing about her sitting-room,
biting his nails in an irritable manner.</p>

<p>"You were at lunch, I think," he said. "I wonder why I was not asked
in?"</p>

<p>Beth said nothing.</p>

<p>"I consider it a slight on Mr. and Mrs. Kilroy's part," he pursued
huffily. "Why should <i>I</i> be singled out for this kind of thing?"</p>

<p>"Aren't you just a little touchy?" Beth suggested.</p>

<p>"I confess I am sensitive, if that is what you mean," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, if you like," she said, "hyper-sensitive. But I thought you
asked for me."</p>

<p>"It is true I came to see you; but that is no reason why I should be
slighted by your friends&mdash;especially when I came because I think I have
something to show you that will interest you." He took a little packet
from the breast-pocket of his coat as he spoke, and began to undo it. "I
took the trouble to go all the way home to get them to show you. My
mother was the only person who had them. They are photographs of myself
when I was a boy."</p>

<p>"I wonder your mother parted with them," Beth said.</p>

<p>"I persuaded her with difficulty," he rejoined complacently. "I have
often tried before, but nothing would induce her to part with them,
until this time, when a bright idea occurred to me. I told her they were
to be published among portraits of celebrated people when my new book
comes out, and naturally she liked the idea. Her only son, you know!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>"And are they to be published?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well&mdash;of course I hope so&mdash;some day," he answered, smiling and
hesitating. "But the truth is I got them for you."</p>

<p>Beth did not thank him, but he was too engrossed with his own portraits
to notice the omission. She was interested in them, too, when at last he
let her look at them.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?" he asked, showing her a good likeness of
himself as she remembered him. "I was a pretty boy then, I think, with
my curls! Burning the midnight oil had not bared my forehead in those
days, and my beard had not grown. Life was all poetry then!" he sighed
affectedly. What had once been spontaneous feeling in him had become a
mere recollection, only to be called up by an effort.</p>

<p>"Later it became all excesses, I suppose," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he ejaculated in a tone of pleased regret. "I had to live like
other men of my standing, you know, and I had to pay for it. The boy was
lost, but the man developed. You may think the change a falling off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He waited for Beth to express an opinion; but as it was impossible for
her to say what she thought of the difference between the conceited,
dissipated-looking, hysterical man of many meannesses, and the diffident
unspoilt promising boy, she held her peace.</p>

<p>When she had seen the photographs, and he had looked at them himself to
his heart's content, he did them up again, and then formally presented
her with the packet. "Will you keep them?" he said solemnly.</p>

<p>"Oh no!" she answered with decision. "I am not the proper person to keep
them. If they did not belong to your mother, they would be for your wife
and children."</p>

<p>"Ah, my wife!" he ejaculated bitterly. "I haven't a word to say against
my wife, remember that! Only&mdash;you are the one to whom I would confide
them."</p>

<p>"I decline the responsibility," Beth said, keeping her countenance with
difficulty.</p>

<p>He returned the packet to the breast-pocket of his coat. "I shall carry
them here, then," he said, tapping his chest with the points of his
fingers, "until you ask for them."</p>

<p>As usual, he stayed a preposterous time that day, and when at last he
went, even Beth's kindly forbearance was exhausted, and she determined
to see no more of him. He was not the man to take a hint, however, and
it was no easy matter to get rid of him. He sent her flowers, for which
she did not thank him, books which she did not read; wrote her long
letters of the clever kind, discussing topics of the day or remarks she
herself had made, which she left unanswered; called, but never found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
her at home, yet still persisted, until she was fain to exclaim: "Will
no one rid me of this troublesome priest?"</p>

<p>"It is your own fault," said Angelica. "I warned you that good-nature is
wasted on that sort of man."</p>

<p>"But surely he must see that I wish to avoid him," Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course he sees it," Angelica rejoined, "but you may be sure that he
interprets your reluctance in some way very flattering to himself."</p>

<p>"I shall really be rude to him," Beth said desperately. "He is a most
exasperating person, the kind of man to drive a woman mad, and then
blame her for it. I pity his wife!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Beth stayed with the Kilroys until the end of June, when the season was
all but over and everybody was leaving town; and it was the busiest and
happiest time she had ever known. She had enjoyed the work, the play,
the society, the solitude, and had blossomed forth in that congenial
atmosphere both mentally and physically, and become a braver and a
better woman.</p>

<p>The Kilroys were to go abroad the day that Beth returned to Slane. The
evening before, she went with Angelica to a theatre. But Angelica, being
much occupied at the moment with arrangements that had to be made for
the carrying on of her special work during her absence, was not able to
stay for the whole performance, so she left Beth alone at the theatre,
and sent the carriage back to take her home.</p>

<p>Beth, sitting in the corner of a box, had eyes for nothing the whole
time but the play, which, being one of those that stimulate the mind,
had appealed to her so powerfully that even after it was over she
remained where she was a little, deep in thought. On leaving the
theatre, she found the footman on the steps looking out for her, and he
remained, standing a little behind her, till the carriage came up. While
she waited, she was annoyed to see Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce making his
way towards her officiously. "You are alone!" he exclaimed, with a note
of critical disapproval in his voice, as if the circumstance reflected
on somebody.</p>

<p>"Hardly!" Beth said, glancing up at her escort. "But even if I were, Mr.
Pounce, I am in London, not in the dark ages, and as sure of respect
here, at the doors of a theatre, as I am in my own drawing-room. I
believe, by the way," she added lightly, not liking to hurt him by too
blunt a snub, "I believe this is the only big city in Europe of which so
much can be said; and English women may thank themselves for it. We
demand not protection, but respect. Here is the carriage. Good night!"
She stepped in as she spoke, and took her seat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh pray, you really must allow me to see you safe home," he exclaimed,
following her into the carriage and taking the seat beside her before
she could remonstrate. The servant shut the door, and they drove away.
Beth boiled with indignation, but she thought it more dignified not to
show it, and she dreaded to have a scene before the servants. Her
demeanour was somewhat frigid, and she left him to open the
conversation; but when he spoke she answered him in her usual tone. He,
on the contrary, was extremely formal. He stroked his pointed beard,
looked out of the window, and made remarks about the weather and the
people in the streets, not avoiding the obvious, which was a relief.</p>

<p>The hall-door was opened as soon as the carriage stopped, and they got
out.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your escort, and good night," Beth said, holding out her
hand to him, but he ignored it.</p>

<p>"I feel faint," he said, and he looked it. "Will you let me come in and
sit down a minute, and give me a glass of water?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," Beth said. "But have something stronger than water.
Come this way, into the library. Roberts, bring Mr. Pounce something to
revive him."</p>

<p>"What will you have, sir?" the butler asked.</p>

<p>"A glass of water, nothing but a glass of water," Mr. Pounce said, most
preciously, sinking into an easy-chair as he spoke.</p>

<p>The butler brought the water, and told Beth that Mr. and Mrs. Kilroy had
not come in. She ordered some tea for herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Pounce sipped the water and appeared to revive.</p>

<p>"I have suffered terribly during the last three weeks," he said at last.</p>

<p>"Have you really?" Beth rejoined with concern. "What was the matter?"</p>

<p>"Need you ask!" he ejaculated. "Why, why have you treated me so?"</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Pounce, I do not see that you have any claim on my special
consideration," Beth answered coldly.</p>

<p>"I have the claim of one who is entirely devoted to you," he said.</p>

<p>"I have never accepted your devotion, and I will not have it forced upon
me," Beth answered decidedly. "I should like you better, to tell the
truth, if you were a little more devoted to your duty."</p>

<p>"You allude to my wife," he said. "Oh, how can I make you understand!
But you have said it yourself&mdash;duty! What is duty? The conscientious
performance of uncongenial tasks. But if a man does his duty, then he
deserves his reward. I do my duty with what heart I have for it. No
fault can be found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
 with me either as a husband or a citizen. Therefore,
as a man, I consider myself entitled to claim my reward."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not well," Beth said. "Don't you think you had
better go home and rest?"</p>

<p>"Not until we come to an understanding," he answered tragically.</p>

<p>Beth shrugged her shoulders resignedly, folded her hands, and waited,
more interested in him as a human specimen in spite of herself than
disturbed by anything his attitude foreboded.</p>

<p>There was a bright wood fire burning on the hearth. Mrs. Kilroy liked to
have one to welcome her when they had been out late, not for warmth so
much as for cheerfulness. The summer midnight was chilly enough,
however, for the gentle heat to be grateful; and Beth turned to the
blaze and gazed into it tranquilly. The clock on the mantelpiece struck
one. Roberts brought in a tray with refreshments on it, and set it down
on a small table beside Beth. Before she helped herself she asked Mr.
Pounce what he would have, but he curtly declined to take anything. She
shrugged her shoulders, and fell-to herself with a healthy appetite.</p>

<p>"How can you&mdash;how can you?" he ejaculated several times.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," she said, laughing, "and I really don't see why I
shouldn't eat."</p>

<p>"You have no feeling for me," he complained.</p>

<p>"I have a sort of feeling that you are posing," she answered bluntly;
"and I wish you wouldn't. You'd better have some sandwiches."</p>

<p>"How terribly complex life is!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"Life is pretty much what we make of it by the way we live it," she
rejoined, taking another sandwich. "We are what we allow ourselves to
be. The complexities come of wrong thinking and wrong doing. Right and
wrong are quite distinct; there is no mistaking one for the other. In
any dilemma we have only to think what is right to be done, and to do
it, and there is an end of all perplexities and complexities. Principle
simplifies everything."</p>

<p>"I see you have never loved," he declared, "or you would not think the
application of principle such a simple thing."</p>

<p>"It is principle that makes love last," Beth answered, "and introduces
something permanent into this weary world of change. There is nothing in
life so well worth living for as principle; the most exquisite form of
pleasure is to be found in the pain of sacrificing one's inclinations in
order to live up to one's principles&mdash;so much so that in time, when
principle and inclination become identical, and we cease to feel
tempted, something of joy is lost, some gladness that was wont to mingle
with the trouble."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p>"But principles themselves are mutable," he maintained. "They get out of
date. And there are, besides, exceptional characters that do not come
under the common law of humanity; exceptional temperaments, and
exceptional circumstances to which common principles are inapplicable,
or for which they are inadequate."</p>

<p>"That is the hypocrisy of the vicious," Beth said, with her eyes fixed
meditatively on the fire, "the people who lay down excellent principles,
and publicly profess them for the sake of standing well with society,
but privately make exceptions for themselves in any arrangement that may
suit their own convenience. Your people of 'exceptional temperament'
settle moral difficulties by not allowing any moral consideration to
clash with their inclinations, and misery comes of it. The plea of
exceptional character, exceptional circumstances, exceptional
temperament, and what not, is merely another way of expressing
exceptional selfishness and excusing exceptional self-indulgence."</p>

<p>"Surely <i>you</i> are not content to be a mere slave to social convention!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am talking of fundamental principles, not of social conventions," she
replied; "please to discriminate. Self-control is not slavery, but
emancipation; to control our passions makes us lords of ourselves and
free of our most galling bonds&mdash;the bonds of the flesh."</p>

<p>"What a drawback the want of&mdash;er&mdash;a proper philosophic training is," he
observed. "Culture does a great deal. It makes us more modest, for one
thing. I don't suppose you know, for instance, that you are setting up
an opinion of your own in opposition to such men as Schopenhauer.
Schopenhauer maintained that as the man of genius gave his whole life
for the profit of humanity, he had a license of conduct which was not
accorded to the rest of mankind."</p>

<p>"If culture leaves us liable to be taken in by a false postulate of any
man's, however well turned the postulate or able the man, then I have no
respect for culture. The fact that Schopenhauer said such a thing does
not prove it true. An assertion like that is a mere matter of opinion.
Half the worry in the world is caused by differences of opinion. Let us
have the facts and form our own opinions. Have the men of genius who
allowed themselves license of conduct been any the better for it? the
happier? the greater? Schopenhauer himself, for instance!" She smiled at
him with honest eyes when she had spoken, and took another sandwich.
"But don't let us talk sophistry and silliness," she proceeded, "nor the
kind of abstract that serves as a cover for unrighteousness. Those
tricks don't carry conviction to my uncultivated mind. I know how
they're done."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are lowering yourself in my estimation," he said severely.</p>

<p>"And what comes after that?" she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head and gazed at her reproachfully. "How can you be so
trivial," he said, "in a moment like this?&mdash;you who are situated even as
I am. If we were to die now, in six months it would be as though we had
never been. No one would remember us."</p>

<p>"But what have we done for any one," Beth asked, in her equable way,
"that we should be specially remembered?"</p>

<p>He made no reply, and Beth went on with the sandwiches.</p>

<p>"I thought," he began at last, "I did think that you at least would
understand and feel for me."</p>

<p>Beth stopped eating and considered a moment.</p>

<p>"Are you in any real trouble?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>He rose and began to pace up and down. "I will tell you," he said, "and
leave you to judge for yourself."</p>

<p>Beth looked somewhat ruefully at the tray, and wished that the
conversation had been more suited to the satisfaction of an honest
appetite.</p>

<p>"I have made it plain to you what my marriage is without blaming
anybody," he proceeded. "It is the rock upon which all my hopes were
wrecked. I found my ideal. I won her like a man. I haven't a word to say
against her. She is a woman who might have made any ordinary man happy;
but she has been no help to me. It is not her fault. She has done her
best. And it is not my fault."</p>

<p>"Then whose fault is it?" said Beth; "it must be somebody's. I think of
marriage as I think of life; it is pretty much what people choose to
make it. It does not fail when husband and wife have good principles,
and live up to them; and good manners in private as well as in
public&mdash;not to mention high ideals. When we are not happy in the
intimate relations of life, it is generally for some trivial reason&mdash;as
often as not because we don't take the trouble to make ourselves
agreeable, as because we fail in other duties. I consider it a duty to
be agreeable. In married life happiness depends on loyalty, to begin
with, the loyalty that will not even let its thoughts stray. All that we
want in everyday intercourse is truth and affection, kindness,
consideration, and unvarying politeness. If people practised these as a
duty from the first, sympathy would eventually come of the effort.
Marriage is the state that develops the noblest qualities, and that is
why happily married people are the best worth knowing, the most
delightful to live amongst. You have no fault to find with your wife,
therefore the fault must be in yourself if you are not happy. Do your
duty like a man, and cure yourself of it."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>"It surprises me to hear you talk in that way," he exclaimed, "you who
have suffered so much yourself!"</p>

<p>"I make no pretence of having suffered," she answered. "I have no
patience with people who do. We have our destiny in our own hands to
make or mar, most of us. If we fail in one thing we shall succeed in
another. Life is a fertile garden, full of plants that bud and blossom
and bear fruit not once but every season while it lasts. If the crop of
happiness fails one year, we should set to work bravely, and cultivate
it all the more diligently for the next."</p>

<p>"All this is beside the mark," he responded peevishly. "You are offering
me the generalisations that only apply to ordinary people. Allowance
<i>must</i> be made for exceptional natures. Look at me! I tell you if I had
met the right woman, I should have been at the top of the tree by this
time. I have the greatest respect for woman. I believe that her part in
life is to fertilise the mind of man; and if the able man does not find
the right woman for this purpose, he must remain sterile, and the world
will be the loser. I never knew such a woman till I met you; but in you
I have discovered one rich in all womanly attributes, mental, moral, and
physical; and, beyond these, dowered also with genius, the divine
gift&mdash;the very woman to help a man to do his best."</p>

<p>"And what is the man going to do for me?" Beth inquired with a twinkle
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"He would surround you with every comfort, every luxury&mdash;jewels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like a ballet-girl!" she interjected. "I am really afraid you are
old-fashioned. You begin by offering me gewgaws&mdash;the paltry price women
set on themselves in the days of their intellectual infancy. We know our
value better now."</p>

<p>"You should have all that an ideal woman ought to have," he put in.
"What more can a woman require?"</p>

<p>"She would like to know what all she ought to have consists of," Beth
replied. "As a rule, a man's ideal woman is some one who will make him
comfortable; and he thinks he has done all that is necessary for her
when he allows her to contribute to his happiness."</p>

<p>"Ah, be serious!" he ejaculated. "You should be above playing in that
cruel way with a man who is in earnest. Hear what I have to say.
Remember <i>we</i> are the people who make history. You talk about knowing
your own value! You do not know it. Without me you never will know it.
You do not know what is being said already about your unpublished work.
Those who have read it tell me you promise to be to England what Georges
Sand was to France when she appeared, a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span> light on the literary
horizon. But where would Georges Sand have been without De Musset? They
owe half their prestige to each other. While they were alive every one
talked of them, and now that they are dead reams are written about them.
Let us also go down to posterity together. All I want is you; what you
want is me. Will you&mdash;will you let me be to you&mdash;De Musset?"</p>

<p>"What you really do want," said Beth, "is a sense of humour."</p>

<p>"For God's sake, do not be trivial!" he exclaimed. "You cannot think
what this means to me&mdash;how I have set my heart on it&mdash;how I already seem
to hear the men at the clubs mention my name and yours when I pass.
Night after night I have paced up and down outside this house, looking
up at your window, thinking it all out."</p>

<p>Beth flushed angrily. "I consider that a most improper proceeding," she
said, "and I do not know how you can excuse it to yourself."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;much may be excused when a man feels as strongly as I do," he
protested.</p>

<p>"And how about your wife?" said Beth, "where do you place her in your
plans? Has she no feelings to be considered?"</p>

<p>"I shall not hurt her feelings, I assure you, I never do," he answered.
"I keep her in a quiet country place so that she may hear no gossip, and
I excuse my long absences from home on the plea of work. She understands
that my interests would suffer if I were not on the spot."</p>

<p>"In other words, you lie to your wife," said Beth, aghast at the shabby
deceit.</p>

<p>"That is scarcely polite language," he rejoined in an offended tone.</p>

<p>"It is correct language," she retorted. "We shall understand what we are
talking about much better if we call things by their right names. But
are you never afraid of what your wife may be driven to in the dulness
of the country, while you are here in town, dancing attendance on other
men's wives?"</p>

<p>"Never in the least," he answered complacently. "She is entirely devoted
to me and to her duty. Her faith in me is absolute."</p>

<p>"And so you deceive her."</p>

<p>"I am not bound to tell her all my doings," he protested.</p>

<p>"You are in honour bound not to deceive her," Beth said; "and if you
deceive her it is none the less low because she does not suspect you. On
the contrary. It seems to me that one of the worst things that can
happen to a man is to have docile women to deal with."</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hear you talk like that," he said. "I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span> really
grieved. It shows a want of refinement that surprises and shocks me. I
maintain that I do her no injury. These things can always be arranged so
that no one is injured; that is all that is necessary."</p>

<p>"These things can never be arranged so that no one is injured," Beth
replied. "We injure ourselves, if no one else. We are bound to
deteriorate when we live deceitfully. How can you be honest and manly
and lead a double life? The false husband in whom his wife believes must
be a sneak; and for the man who rewards a good faithful wife by
deceiving her, I have no term of contempt sufficiently strong."</p>

<p>"I am disappointed in you," he said. "I should never have suspected that
you were so narrow and conventional."</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to defy public opinion?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"No, that would be gross," he said. "Outwardly we must conform. Only the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> understand these things, and only the <i>&eacute;lite</i> need know of them.
You are of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> yourself; you must know, you must feel the power,
the privilege conferred by a great passion."</p>

<p>"Pray do not class me with the <i>&eacute;lite</i> if passion is what they respect,"
Beth said. "Passion at the best&mdash;honourable passion&mdash;is but the
efflorescence of a mere animal function. The passion that has no
honourable object is a gaudy, unwholesome weed, rapid of growth, swift
and sure to decay."</p>

<p>"Passion is more than that, the passion of which I speak. It is a great
mental stimulant," he declared.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Beth, "passion is a great mental stimulant&mdash;passion
resisted."</p>

<p>"Georges Sand, whom I would have you follow, always declared that she
only wrote her best under the influence of a strong passion," he assured
her.</p>

<p>"But how do we know that she might not have written better than that
best under some holier influence?" Beth rejoined. "George Eliot's
serener spirit appeals to me more. I believe it is only those who
renounce the ruinous riot of the senses, and find their strength and
inspiration in contemplation, who reach the full fruition of their
powers. Ages have not talked for nothing of the pains of passion and the
pleasures of love. Love is a great ethical force; but passion, which is
compact of every element of doubt and deceit, is cosmic and brutal, a
tyrant if we yield to it, but if we master it, an obedient servant
willing to work. I would rather die of passion myself, as I might of any
other disease, than live to be bound by it."</p>

<p>Pounce, who had been pacing about the room restlessly until now, sat
down by the fire, and gazed into it for a little, discomfited. He had
come primed with the old platitudes, the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span> sophistries, the old
flatteries, come to treat amicably, and found himself met with armed
resistance, his flatteries and platitudes ridiculed, his sophistries
exposed, and his position attacked with the confidence and courage of
those who are sure of themselves.</p>

<p>"Have you no feeling for me?" he said at last, after a long pause,
speaking somewhat hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for you," was the unexpected answer.</p>

<p>"Pity is akin to love," he said.</p>

<p>"Pity is also akin to contempt," she rejoined. "And how can a woman feel
anything else for a man who is false to the most sacred obligations? who
makes vows and breaks them according to his inclination? If we make a
law of our own inclinations, what assurance can we give to any one that
we shall ever be true?"</p>

<p>"I have found at last what I have yearned for all my life long," he
protested. "I know I shall never waver in my devotion to you."</p>

<p>"That may be," she answered. "But what guarantee could you give me that
<i>I</i> should not waver? What comfort would your fidelity be if I tired of
you in a month?"</p>

<p>Again he was discomfited, and there was another pause.</p>

<p>"If you did change," he said at last, "I should be the only sufferer."</p>

<p>Beth sat silent for a little, then she said slowly, "What you have
ventured to propose to me to-night, Mr. Cayley Pounce, is no more credit
to your intelligence than it is to your principles. You come here and
find me living openly, in an assured position, with powerful friends,
whose affection and respect for me rest on their confidence in me, and
with brilliant prospects besides, as you say, which, however, depend to
a great extent upon my answering to the expectations I have raised. You
allow that I have some ability, some sense, and yet you offer me in
exchange for all these&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I offer you <i>love</i>!" he exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p>"Love!" she ejaculated with contempt, "you offer me yourself for a
lover, and you seek to inspire confidence in me by deceiving your wife.
You would have me sacrifice a position of safety for a position of
danger&mdash;one that might be changed into an invidious position by the
least indiscretion&mdash;and all for what?"</p>

<p>"For love of you," he pleaded, "that I may help you to develop the best
that is in you."</p>

<p>"All for the prestige of having your name associated with mine by men
about town in the event of mine becoming distinguished," she
interrupted.</p>

<p>He winced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only ask you to do what George Eliot did greatly to her advantage,"
he answered reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You asked me to do what Georges Sand did greatly to her detriment,"
Beth said. "George Eliot is an after-thought. And you certainly have no
intention of asking me to do what she did, for she acted openly, she
deceived no one, and injured no one."</p>

<p>"And you do not blame her?" he exclaimed with a flash of hope.</p>

<p>Beth answered indirectly: "When I think about that, I ask myself have
Church and State arranged the relations of the sexes successfully enough
to convince us that they cannot be better arranged? Are marriages holier
now than they were in the days when there were no churches to bless
them? or happier here than in other countries where they are simple
private contracts? And it seems to me that we have no historical proof
that the legal bond is necessarily the holiest between man and woman, or
that there is never justification for a more irregular compact. I know
that 'holy matrimony' is often a state of absolute degradation,
especially for the woman; and I believe that two honourable people can
live together honourably without the conventional bond, so long as no
one else is injured, no previous compact broken. But all the same I
think the legal bond is best. It is a safeguard to the family and a
restraint on the unprincipled. And, at any rate, all my experience, all
my thought, all my hope argue for the dignity of permanence in human
relations. Anything else is bad for the individual, for the family, for
the state. As civilisation, as evolution advances from lower to higher,
we find it makes more and more for monogamy. Our highest types of men
and women are monogamous. Those whose contracts are lightly made and
lightly broken are trivial people. That useful Oneida Creek experiment
proved that the instinct, if not the ideal, of modern humanity is
monogamous."</p>

<p>"What was that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A number of people formed a community at Oneida Creek to live together
in a kind of ordered promiscuity, but the experiment failed because it
was found eventually that the members were living together secretly in
pairs. No. The more I know of life the less I like the idea of allowing
any laxity in the marriage relation. In certain cases of course there is
good and sufficient reason for two people to separate. But I believe
that right-minded people can generally, and almost always do, make their
marriages answer. Marriage is compact of every little incident in life,
it is not merely made up of one strong feeling, otherwise men and women
would be as the animals who pair and part casually; therefore, if two
people are disappointed in each other in some things, they must have
other things in common to fall back upon. My ideal of life is love in
marriage and loyal friends."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is interesting to hear you express these views," he said bitterly,
"considering what your experience has been."</p>

<p>"I don't see that my petty personal experience has anything to do with
the truth of the matter," said Beth, bridling somewhat. "You really have
a poor opinion of me if you think I shall allow my judgment to be warped
by anything that may happen to myself. Because my own experience is not
a happy one, you would have me declare that family life is a mistake!
Doubtless many an outcry is raised for no better reason. But do you not
see yourself that the tranquil home-life is the most beautiful, the most
conducive to the development of all that is best in us&mdash;that there is
nothing like the delight of being a member of a large and united family.
Can you come into a house like this and not see it?"</p>

<p>"This house was not always a model of domestic felicity," he sneered.</p>

<p>"That proves my point," she rejoined. "The difficulties can be lived
down if people are right-minded."</p>

<p>"Your argument does not alter the fact that I am a miserable man," he
said dejectedly.</p>

<p>"You were not born to be a miserable man," she answered gently, "and 'we
always may be what we might have been.' But you have lost much ground,
Alfred Cayley Pounce, since the days when you roamed about the cliffs
and sandy reaches of Rainharbour with Beth Caldwell, making plans. You
had your ideals then, and lived up to them. You cultivated your flowers
for delight in their beauty, and went to your modelling for love of the
work. You gave your flowers to your friends with an honest intention to
please; you modelled with honest ambition to do good work. In those days
you were above caring to cultivate the acquaintance of the best people.
You had touched the higher life at that time; you had felt such rapture
in it as has never come to you since&mdash;even among the best people&mdash;I am
sure; yet you fell away; you deserted Beth&mdash;not basely, perhaps, but
weakly; and you have been deteriorating ever since."</p>

<p>He had started straight in his chair when she mentioned Beth Caldwell,
and was staring at her now with puzzled intentness.</p>

<p>"What do you know about Beth?" he said quickly. "Have you ever met her?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "I can honestly say I never have," she answered. But she
looked away from him into the fire as she spoke, and he recognised the
set of her head on her shoulders as she turned it; he had noted it
often.</p>

<p>"God!" he exclaimed, "what a blind idiot I have been&mdash;Beth! Beth!" He
threw himself down on his knees beside her chair, caught her hand, and
covered it with kisses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth snatched her hand away, and he returned embarrassed to his seat and
sat gazing at her for a little, then took out his handkerchief and
suddenly burst into tears.</p>

<p>"What a mess I have made of my life!" he exclaimed. "Everything that
would have been best for me has been within reach at some time or other,
but I invariably took the wrong thing and let the right one go. But,
Beth, I was only a boy then, and I suffered when they separated us."</p>

<p>This reflection seemed to ease his mind on the subject. That she might
also have suffered did not occur to him; as usual his whole concern was
for himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right, Beth," he proceeded. "I <i>have</i> deteriorated; but
'we always may be what we might have been'&mdash;and you have been sent to me
again as a sign that it is not too late for me. You were my first love,
my earliest ideal, and I have not changed, you see, I have been true to
you; for, although I never suspected you were Beth, I recognised my
rightful mate in you the moment we met. Yes, I was on the right road
when we were boy and girl together, but the promise of that time has not
been fulfilled. All the poetry in me has lain dormant since the days
when you drew it forth. I gave up modelling when I went to the 'Varsity
because they didn't care for that kind of thing in my set, you know.
They were all men of position, who wouldn't associate with artists
unless they were at the top of the tree; clever fellows, and good
themselves at squibs and epigrams. If you'd ever been to the 'Varsity
you'd know that a man must adapt himself to his environment if he means
to get on. My dream had been to make my visions of beauty visible, as
you used to suggest; but I had to give that up, there was nothing else
for it. Still, I was not content to do nothing, to be nobody; therefore,
when I abandoned the clay, I took to the pen; I gave up the marble for
the manuscript. Many men of position have written, you know, and so long
as you didn't mug, fellows didn't mind. In fact, they thought you smart
if they fancied you could dash things off without an effort. You
understand now why I am a literary man instead of a sculptor."</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Beth said drily. "It was in those days, I suppose, that you
were bitten by French literature, and began to idealise mean intrigues,
and to delight in foul matter if the manner of its presentation were an
admirable specimen of style."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said solemnly, "style is everything."</p>

<p>"It is all work of word-turning and little play of fancy with those who
make style everything," said Beth, glad to get away from love, "and that
makes your Jack-of-style a dull boy and morbid in spite of his polish.
Less style and more humour would be the saving of some of you, the
making of others."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>"Flaubert wrote 'Madame Bovary' six times," he assured her impressively.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much it lost each time," said Beth. "But you know what
Flaubert himself said about style before he had done&mdash;just what I am
saying!"</p>

<p>"I cannot understand your being insensible to the charms of style," he
said, evading the thrust.</p>

<p>"I am not. I only say it is not of the most vital importance. Thackeray
was a Titan&mdash;well, look at his slipshod style in places, his careless
grammar, his constant tautology. He knew better, and he could have done
better, and it would have been well if he had, I don't deny it; but his
work would not have been a scrap more vital, nor he himself the greater.
I have seen numbers of people here in town studying art. They go to the
schools to learn to draw, not because they have ideas to express,
apparently, but in the hope that ideas will come when they know how to
express them. And I think it is the same in literature. One school talks
of style as if it were the end and not the means. They form a style, but
have nothing to express that is worth expressing. It would be better to
pray the gods to send them the matter; if the matter is there in the
mind it will out, and the manner will form itself in the effort to
produce it&mdash;so said the great."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which Alfred Cayley Pounce sighed heavily and
Beth looked at the clock.</p>

<p>"You were stimulating as a child, Beth," he said at last, "and you are
stimulating still. Think what it would be to me to have you always by my
side! I cannot&mdash;I cannot let you go again now that I have found you! We
were boy and girl together."</p>

<p>"That does not alter anything in our present position," Beth answered;
"nor does it affect my principles in any way. But even if I had been
inclined&mdash;if I had had no principles, I should have been just clever
enough to know better than to run any risk of the kind you suggest. You
do not know perhaps that you have injured your own standing
already&mdash;that there are houses in which you are not welcome because you
are suspected of intrigue."</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>&mdash;suspected of intrigue!" he exclaimed. "It isn't possible!"</p>

<p>Beth laughed. "If it is so disagreeable to be suspected," she said,
"what would it be to be found out! And what have you gained by it? What
says the Dhammapada? '<i>There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to
hell); there is the short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the
frightened, and the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man
think of his neighbour's wife.</i>'"</p>

<p>"It is evident that you don't trust me," he said in an injured tone.
"Ah, Beth! does the fact that we were boy and girl together not weigh
with you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it would," Beth said soberly, "even if worldly wisdom were my
only guide in life. I should think of the time that we got into that
scrape, and you wriggled out of it, leaving me to shift for myself as
best I could; and I should remember the boy is father to the man. But I
have been trying to show you that worldly wisdom is not my only guide in
life. I have professed the most positive puritan principles of conduct,
and given you the reasons upon which they are based, yet you persist;
you ignore what I say as if you had not heard me or did not believe me,
and pursue the subject as if you were trying to weary me into agreement.
And you have wearied me, but not into agreement; so, if you please, we
will not discuss it any longer."</p>

<p>"You will be sorry, I think, some day for the way you have treated me,"
he exclaimed, showing temper; "and what you expect to gain by it I
cannot imagine."</p>

<p>"Oh, please," Beth protested, "I am not imbued with the commercial
spirit of the churches. I do not expect a percentage in the way of
reward on every simple duty I do."</p>

<p>"Virtue is its own reward," he sneered.</p>

<p>"It has been said that 'the pleasure of virtue is one which can only be
obtained on the express condition of its not being the object sought,'"
she rejoined good-naturedly. "Try it, Alfred, and see if you do not
become a happier man insensibly. Order your thoughts to other and nobler
ends, for thoughts are things, and we are branded or beautified by them.
An American scientist has been making experiments to test the effect of
thought on the body, and has found that a continuous train of evil
thought injures the health and spoils the personal appearance, but high
and holy thoughts have a beautifying effect. Be a man and embrace a
manly creed. <i>Live for others, live openly.</i> Deceit is treachery, and
treachery is cowardice of the most despicable kind. Life has to be
lived. It might as well be lived earnestly. Life is better lived when it
is held earnestly. Personally I detest all flippancy and cynicism, all
cheapening of serious subjects by lack of reverence. Irreverence
portends defects of character and poverty of intellect. All serious
subjects are sacred subjects, and to treat them with levity or
insincerity is to prove yourself a person to be avoided."</p>

<p>Alfred Cayley Pounce was stooping forward with his elbows on his knees
and his face between his hands, gazing blankly into the fire. The light
shone on his bald forehead and accentuated the lines which wounded
vanity, petty purposes thwarted, and an ignoble life had written
prematurely on his face, and his attitude emphasised the attenuation of
his body. He looked a poor, peevish, neurotic specimen; and although he
had only himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
 to thank for it, Beth, remembering the promise of his
youth, felt a qualm of pity.</p>

<p>"What a mistake my marriage has been!" he ejaculated at last. "But I
doubt if I should ever have found a woman who would have understood me
enough to be all in all to me. For a man of my temperament there is
nothing but celibacy."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in celibacy at all," Beth said cheerfully. "Celibacy is
an attempt to curb a healthy instinct with a morbid idea. He is the best
man and the truest gentleman who honourably fulfils every function of
life. And I don't believe your marriage was of necessity a mistake
either. But if you must be miserable, be loyal as well. You will find
that the best in the end. If, being miserable, we are also disloyal,
then we are insensibly degraded&mdash;so insensibly, perhaps, that we are not
conscious of any part of the process, and only become aware of what has
been going on when we have to face a crisis, and find ourselves prepared
to act ignobly, and to justify the act with specious excuses." She
glanced up at the mantelpiece. "Come," she said, "it is four o'clock,
and I am sleepy. I must go to bed."</p>

<p>He started to his feet. "Good heavens!" he exclaimed, "you can talk of
being sleepy when I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that now," said Beth, yawning frankly. "Everybody has
gone to bed and forgotten us, I suppose. I shall have to let you out."</p>

<p>She gathered the evening cloak she had come back in from the theatre
about her as she spoke, and led the way. He let her open the hall-door
for him. It was grey daylight in the street. At the foot of the steps a
policeman was standing on the pavement making a note in a little book.</p>

<p>"Is it any use whistling for a hansom at this hour?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>The policeman looked up at her. "I'll try, miss, if you like," he said.</p>

<p>He whistled several times, but there was no response, and Alfred Cayley
Pounce at last crammed his hat down on his head with a peevish show of
impatience, and walked off down the street, without a word of
leave-taking. The fact that Beth was sleepy had wounded his vanity more
than any word she had said. She smiled and shrugged her shoulders as she
watched him depart, then went down on to the pavement and strolled
about, enjoying the freshness. The policeman kept watch and ward,
meanwhile, at the open door, and, before she went in, Beth stood and
talked to him a little in her pretty kindly way. She found his tone and
manner in their simple directness strengthening and refreshing to the
mind after the tortuous posings of Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX"></a>CHAPTER XLIX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> breakfast next morning Beth described the way in which Mr. Alfred
Cayley Pounce had forced his attentions upon her the night before. Mr.
Kilroy was exceedingly angry. "He shall not come into any house of mine
again," he declared, and gave the old butler Roberts, who happened to be
the only servant in the room at the moment, orders to that effect. "Do
you mean to say," he asked Beth, "that the fellow had the assurance to
tell you he had actually been hanging about the house?"</p>

<p>"He seemed rather proud of that, as of something poetical and romantic,"
Beth answered.</p>

<p>"I suppose the illness was all an excuse," Angelica observed.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Beth said. "He certainly looked ill, but he's a poor
neurotic creature now, and might easily work himself up into a state of
hysterical collapse, I should think. What was your impression, Roberts?"</p>

<p>"He looked real bad, ma'am; and well he might, the way he's been goin'
on, 'anging about 'alf the night We've all seen im," Roberts rejoined
imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you report it to me?" Mr. Kilroy wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I couldn't be sure it was this 'ouse, sir, in partic'lar.
You see there's a good many in the square, sir. I was just waitin' to
make sure. He come after you'd gone last night, and said he 'ad to meet
the ladies, but he'd forgotten where they were goin' to, and James,
suspectin' nothin', told 'im."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think he will trouble me again," Beth said cheerfully,
concerned to see Mr. Kilroy so seriously annoyed. "I told him what I
thought of him in such unmistakable terms that he walked out of the
house without any form of farewell."</p>

<p>Angelica looked grave. "I am afraid you've made a spiteful enemy, Beth,"
she observed. "That kind of cat-man is capable of any meanness if his
vanity is wounded; if he can injure you, he will."</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, I don't see what he can do," said Mr. Kilroy.</p>

<p>"He can supply the press with odious personal paragraphs, spread
calumnies at the clubs, and write scratch-cat criticisms on the book
when it appears," Angelica said. "There are plenty of people who will
listen to that kind of man, and take their opinions from him."</p>

<p>"But what does it matter," said Beth in her tolerant way. "All you whom
I love and respect will judge me and my work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
 for yourselves. If you are
pleased, I shall rejoice; if you find fault, I shall be grateful and
profit. But I should be a poor shallow thing, like society itself, if I
allowed myself to be disturbed or influenced by the Alfred Cayley
Pounces of the press. And as to society!" Beth laughed. "At first, when
I went anywhere, I used to ask myself all the time when would the
pleasure begin! But now I am younger, thanks to you; and I enjoy
everything. I look on and laugh. But for the rest, I must be
indifferent. It would be an insult to one's intellect to set any store
on such tinsel as that of which the verdicts of society are made."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Beth had been thinking a good deal about Dan lately, and had come to the
conclusion that, with all his faults, he was very much to be preferred
to the Alfred Cayley Pounce kind of creature. She had more hope of him,
somehow; and she went back determined that it should not be her fault if
they did not arrive at a better understanding. He gave her a good
opportunity on the evening of her arrival. They were sitting out in the
garden after dinner, on that comfortable seat by the privet hedge which
Beth overlooked from her secret chamber. Behind them the hedge was
thick, and in front a border of flowers surrounded a little green lawn,
which was shut in beyond by a belt of old trees in full foliage. It was
an exquisite evening, warm and still; and Dan, having dined well, and
begun a good cigar, was in a genial mood. As he grew older he attached a
more enormous importance than ever to meals. If the potatoes were boiled
when he wanted them mashed or baked, it made a serious difference to
him, and he would grow red in the face and shout at the servants if his
eggs for breakfast were done a moment more or less than he liked. He was
a ridiculous spectacle in his impatience if dinner were late, and a sad
one in his sensual satisfaction if it answered to his expectations. Beth
watched him at such times with sensations that passed through various
degrees of irritation from positive contempt to the kindly tolerance one
feels for the greed of a hungry child. Dan had been "doing himself
well," as he called it, during her absence, and was looking somewhat
bloated and blotched. His wonderful complexion was no longer so clear
and bright as it had been; the red was redder and the white opaque. A
few more years and his character would be seen distinctly in the shape
and colour of his face; and Beth, who had marked the first signs of
deterioration slowly set in, was saddened by the progress it had made.
Alfred Cayley Pounce would succumb to his nerves, Daniel Maclure to his
tissues; the one was earning atrophy for himself, the other fatty
degeneration. Beth was right. The real old devil is disease, and our
evil appetites are his ministers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<p>"You seem solemn this evening," Daniel said to her. "I suppose you're
regretting your friends."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Beth; "but I have been away long enough, and I am glad to be
back. I saw some things in the great wicked city that made me
think&mdash;Dan," she broke off abruptly, "I wish you and I were better
friends. So very little would bring us to a right understanding, and I
am sure we should both be the better and the happier."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself," said Dan complacently. "Personally, I feel good
enough and happy enough. We have our differences, like other people, I
suppose; but whose fault is that, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"Partly mine," Beth acknowledged. "I don't think I should have been so
defiant. But if you had been different, I should have been different."</p>

<p>"If <i>I</i> had been different!" he ejaculated, knocking the ash from the
end of his cigar. "Well, I'd like to know what fault you have to find
with me? Different indeed!"</p>

<p>"That is the principal one," Beth answered, smiling. "Your great fault
is that you don't believe you have any faults."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he conceded, "of course I know I've my faults. Who hasn't?
But I'll undertake to say that they're a <i>man's</i> faults. Now, come!"</p>

<p>This reflection seemed to deepen his self-satisfaction, as if it must be
allowed that he was all the better for the faults to which he alluded.
As he spoke, Beth seemed to see him at her wardrobe with his hand in the
pocket of one of her dresses, hunting for treasonable matter to satisfy
his evil suspicions, and she sighed. She would not acknowledge to
herself that she was fighting for the impossible, yet even at the outset
she half despaired of ever making him understand. It is pitiful to think
of her, with her tender human nature, seeking a true mate where human
law required that she should find one, only to be repulsed and baffled
and bedraggled herself in the end if she persevered. A good man might
have failed to comprehend Beth, but a good man would have felt the force
of goodness in her, and would have reverenced her. Maclure recognised no
force in her and felt no reverence; all that was not animal in her was
as obscure to him as to the horse in his stable that whinnied a welcome
to her when she came because he expected sugar. It is pleasant to give
pleasure; but there must be more in marriage for it to be satisfactory
than free scope to exercise the power to please.</p>

<p>"Well, look here, Dan," Beth pursued. "I'll make a bargain with you. If
you will do your best to correct your faults&mdash;what <i>I</i> think your
faults&mdash;I'll do my best to correct all you find in me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span> Only let us
discuss them temperately, and try conscientiously to live up to some
ideals of thought and conduct."</p>

<p>Dan smoked on silently for a little, then he said, with some show of
irritation tempering his self-satisfaction, "Well, all I can say is, I
cannot for the life of me see what you have to complain of."</p>

<p>"I have to complain of your conduct with Bertha Petterick, for one
thing," Beth answered desperately. "Let us be frank with each other. I
know that you have not been loyal to me. I saw you together here on this
seat the day you gave her the bracelet. I saw you put it on her arm and
kiss her; and that decided me to go to Ilverthorpe."</p>

<p>Dan looked round about him with an altered countenance, but nothing that
he knew to be a window overlooked the spot, neither was it possible to
see through the thickness of the privet hedge, nor from any other point,
without being seen.</p>

<p>"You must have imagined it!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I did not imagine that bracelet," Beth replied.</p>

<p>"Well, even if I did give her the bracelet," he said, "you're not going
to be nasty-minded enough to insinuate that there was anything in that!"</p>

<p>"There was deceit in it," Beth answered, "and in your whole attitude
towards that girl while she was under this roof. If we act so that we
cannot be open and honest about our dealings with people, then there
must be something wrong. Life would be intolerable if it had to be lived
among people any one of whom, while professing friendship for us, was
deceiving us in some vital particular. From the moment that we act on
our own inclinations rather than up to what the noblest of our friends
expect of us, we have gone wrong. But you and I are both young enough,
Dan, to put the past behind us, and forget it. Let us start together
afresh in another place, where there will be no evil associations,
nothing to vex us by reminding us of unhappy days; and let us be loyal
to each other, and honest and open in every act, making due allowance
for each other, and doing our best to help and please each other. We
shall be happy, I am sure. You will see we shall be very happy."</p>

<p>Dan took his cigar out of his mouth, and flicked the ash from the end of
it with his little finger: "You'd have me give up my appointment here, I
suppose, and the half of my income with it?"</p>

<p>"Most of all I would have you give up your appointment here," she
answered earnestly. "No honest woman can endure to have her husband
pandering to vice. It would not be so much of a sacrifice either," she
added, "for the next session will end this iniquity."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks to the influence of you cursed women," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Thanks to our influence, yes," she answered dispassionately, "and to
some sense of justice in men."</p>

<p>"If you knew how men talk about women who meddle in these matters," he
said, "you would keep out of them, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know the kind of thing they say," she answered, smiling; "but the
people you mean have no influence nowadays. The blatant protest of the
debauched against our demand for a higher standard of life is not the
voice of the community. It is the cry of those who feel their existence
threatened, who only live upon lies, and must be extinguished when the
inevitable day of reckoning comes which shall expose them. Even now the
kind of man who catches at every straw of opinion which shall secure to
him his sacred carnal rights, at no matter what cost of degradation and
disease to women, is out of date, and we pay no attention to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, women!" Dan jeered. "That is all very fine! But who the devil cares
what women think?"</p>

<p>"Now don't be old-fashioned, Dan," Beth answered, laughing. "When women
only did what they were told, men used to vow at their feet that there
was nothing they couldn't accomplish, their influence was so great. But
now that women have proved that what they choose to do they can do, men
sneer at their pretensions to power, and try to depreciate them by
comparing the average woman with men in the front rank of their
professions. Really, men are disheartening."</p>

<p>The evening calm had deepened about them, a big bright star was shining
above the belt of trees, and waves of perfume from the flowers made the
air a delight to inhale.</p>

<p>"What a heavenly night!" Beth pursued. "Who would live in London when
they might be here?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's consistent!" he exclaimed, "after entreating me to leave
the place!"</p>

<p>"This is not the only peaceful spot in the world," she said with a
little sigh; "and I would rather live in London even than have you here
in an invidious position. Dan, give it up, there's a good fellow! and
learn to look on life from this newer, wider point of view. You will
find interests and pleasures in it you have never even suspected, I
assure you, and you will never regret it."</p>

<p>"For the life of me," he said again, throwing the end of his cigar into
the bushes with an irritated jerk of his arm,&mdash;"for the life of me, I
cannot see what you have to complain of; and I shall certainly not give
up any bird in the hand for two such birds in the bush as you promise
me." He rose as he spoke,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
 and shook out first one leg and then the
other to straighten his trousers. "I'm going out," he added. "I've a
patient to see. Ta! ta! Take care of yourself."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Some little time after Beth's return, they were sitting at lunch
together, and Maclure was reading a daily paper.</p>

<p>"Matters look bad for that fellow, Cayley Pounce," he observed.</p>

<p>"Why, what has he been doing?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Poking a fellow's eye out with his umbrella," Dan answered. "He was
talking to a girl in the street one night, and got into a row with some
roughs, and jabbed one in the eye with his umbrella, and the fellow
died. The inquiry is now going on, and it's likely the coroner's jury
will bring in a verdict of manslaughter against Mr. Cayley Pounce. His
defence is that he wasn't anywhere near that part of London on that
particular night, and it's a case of mistaken identity; but as he
refuses to say where he was, and produces no evidence by way of an
alibi, that story won't avail him much."</p>

<p>"What night was it?" said Beth.</p>

<p>"On the 30th, just after midnight," Dan read out of the paper.</p>

<p>"Why, that was the night he insisted on escorting me home from the
theatre," Beth exclaimed. "He did not leave the Kilroys' until four
o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth doesn't he say so?" Dan asked.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine," Beth said. "I let him out myself; everybody else had
gone to bed. And I'm sure of the time, because I thought he was never
going away, and I was tired; and I looked at the clock and said, 'It's
four o'clock, and I must go to bed.'"</p>

<p>Dan's face had darkened. "Do you mean to say you were sitting up with
him alone?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, for my sins!" Beth answered in a tone of disgust. "The Kilroys
were out when I returned from the theatre, and did not come in till very
late; and they went straight upstairs, supposing I had gone to bed. As a
rule they come into the library first. So Mr. Cayley Pounce was left on
my hands."</p>

<p>"Then," said Dan, pushing his plate away from him with a clatter, "it is
obvious why he is holding his tongue. He is determined not to compromise
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Beth, bridling. "I should think I am not so easily
compromised."</p>

<p>"Gad!" Dan ejaculated, "I don't know what you call easily compromised! A
man takes you home from a theatre, and stays with you alone till four
o'clock in the morning; if that isn't compromising I don't know what is.
No jury in the world would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
 acquit you, and the fellow knows that
perfectly well, and is holding his tongue to screen you."</p>

<p>"I should think it's a great deal more likely he's holding his tongue in
order to get the credit of it," Beth observed drily. "It is a mere pose.
He knows I shall have to come forward to clear him if he doesn't explain
himself. I suppose I must go at once and stop the case; but if it were
not for his wife I declare I should hesitate. What is the form of
procedure? You will come with me, of course?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> go with you!" Dan exclaimed brutally, "and see you make a public
exhibition of yourself, and bring disgrace on my name in a court of
justice! I'm damned if I do! And what's more, if you go, you don't
return to this house. I've too much self-respect for that. You hadn't
much of a reputation when I married you, and if you lose the little
you've got, you can go and I shall divorce you. My wife must be above
suspicion."</p>

<p>Beth folded her serviette slowly while he was speaking, and, when he
stopped, she rose from the table.</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate for me," she said, "that the Kilroys have gone
abroad. They know the man and the facts of the case, and would have
advised me. In their absence I must do what seems right without advice.
I cannot see that I have any choice in the matter. You could make it
perfectly easy for me by supporting me; if you do not support me I must
go alone. I shall pack up and go to town at once in order to appear in
court to-morrow morning, and I shall telegraph to Roberts, the Kilroys'
butler, to meet me there, and confirm my story. There are the coachman
and footman too, and the police constable&mdash;witnesses enough, in all
conscience."</p>

<p>"You are determined to go?" Dan demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"I must go," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"It is going to the devil, then," said Dan deliberately; "and I always
said you would. Remember, you don't return to this house!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>When Beth arrived in town, she found that there would be no need to
appear in the case at all, for the Kilroys' old butler Roberts had seen
the name of Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce in the papers, and had unwittingly
frustrated his man&oelig;uvre by going to the coroner's court himself and
volunteering to give evidence. He was accompanied by the footman who had
been out with the carriage on the night in question, and the two
together had no difficulty in proving an alibi. Thus, in an ordinary
commonplace manner, what had promised to be the triumph of his life, the
moment when he should stand confessed to the world a chivalrous
gentleman, sacrificing himself to save a lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span> of prepossessing
appearance, was converted into another of the many failures of Mr.
Alfred Cayley Pounce. This ended the case so far as he and Beth were
concerned; but with regard to Dan, Beth recognised that her position
remained the same. There was no return for her from the step she had
taken, and she would have to begin her life anew.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L"></a>CHAPTER L</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth</span> went out into the world alone, knowingly and willingly. The
prospect had no terrors for her, neither did she feel any regret for the
past. She took it all as a matter of course. The days with Dan at Slane
were over, but life had still to be lived, and she set to work to
arrange it and live it to the best of her ability; what she most
urgently felt being merely that there were things she must see to at
once and settle about, and that she was rather pushed for time. The
first thing she did in London was to buy a map so that she might find
her way about economically, and some newspapers recommended to her by
the stationers as likely to have advertisements of respectable lodgings
in them. She studied these over a cup of coffee and a roll, cut all the
promising addresses out of the papers, found on the map the best way to
go by omnibus or railway, and then set off on her quest, taking the red
Hammersmith 'bus first of all, and explored West Kensington. Her efforts
in that direction were not successful. Everything she saw at first was
dear, dingy, and disheartening. Landladies, judging her by her
appearance, would only show her their best rooms. When she explained
that all she wanted was a nice, clean, roomy attic because she was poor,
they became suspicious, and declared that she wasn't likely to get
anything of that sort in a good neighbourhood. Beth wondered what the
bad neighbourhoods were like if the one she was in were a good one.
Later in the afternoon she found herself on the Bayswater side in a
street of tall houses off the main thoroughfare. They were good houses,
that must have been built for the families of affluent people, and Beth
was afraid it would be useless to ask at any of them for the modest kind
of accommodation which was all she could afford. While she hesitated,
however, standing in the street before the one she had come to find, the
hall-door opened, and a young man came out. He and Beth looked at each
other as he ran down the steps, and Beth saw something so attractive in
his face that she spoke to him without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me," she said, "if they have any attics to let at a
moderate price in this house?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> got one out of them," he said, smiling, "and I guess there's
another empty that would just about hold you, dress boxes and all. I'll
ring the bell, if you'll allow me, and get Ethel Maud Mary to show you
up. You'll make a better bargain with her than with her ma."</p>

<p>The door was opened at this moment by a grimy servant.</p>

<p>"Gwendolen, will you give my compliments to Miss Ethel, if you please,"
the young man said with grave formality, "and ask her if she will be so
good as to speak to me here for a moment."</p>

<p>Gwendolen nodded and retired to the back regions, whence presently a
plump, fair-complexioned, yellow-haired young person came hurrying with
a look of inquiry on her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Ethel," the young man began, taking off his hat, "I'm real
sorry to trouble you, but I want to introduce this young lady. I've been
recommending her to get a room here. I know she'll find you moderate and
comfortable, and the situation is one of the best for getting into
town."</p>

<p>Beth recognised the wording of the advertisement that had brought her to
the house.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> handy," Miss Ethel agreed. "But we've nothing but an attic
unlet. Are you in Art, miss?"</p>

<p>"No, Literature," Beth answered, with presence of mind.</p>

<p>"<i>Lady's</i>, I suppose?" Ethel Maud Mary observed, meaning lady's papers,
and glancing at Beth's dress. "You've got to be smart for that, and it
doesn't leave much for living. Come this way, miss, please. And thank
you, Mr. Brock, for mentioning us."</p>

<p>She led the way upstairs, talking all the time with cheerful
inconsequence. "He's a real gentleman is Mr. Brock, as doubtless you
know, though an American, and dry, and you never know which is his fun;
and in Art, which is not much to reckon on, and that's why I thought
that you might be, though you do look more like Fashion. Art is apt to
be towzled, but why, goodness knows. You're not used to the stairs, I
see. I wish it wasn't such a height up."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind the height, if the price is proportionately low," Beth
said. "I must live within my means, and keep out of debt, you know."</p>

<p>"That's a rhyme&mdash;low and you know. Did you do it on purpose?" Ethel Maud
Mary asked with interest.</p>

<p>"No," said Beth.</p>

<p>"Then that's for luck," said Ethel. "You'll keep out of debt all right.
I see it in your face. And I know a face when I see it. They'll keep you
on the <i>Lady's</i> for the sake of your appearance, even if you're not much
use. You're elegant and speak nice, and that's what they want to go
about for them, particularly if it's a man."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span></p>

<p>"If what is a man?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"The editor, you know. We 'ad a young lady here who used to say she'd
undertake to get an extra half-sovereign out of any editor in town; but
editresses there was no managing. Which is yours?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," said Beth. "I've only just arrived."</p>

<p>"What are you getting?"</p>

<p>"A pound a week," Beth answered, that being her exact income; "but I
have a little by me besides, to keep me going till I get started, you
know."</p>

<p>Ethel Maud Mary nodded her yellow head intelligently, and began to climb
the narrow flight of stairs which led to the attics, moving her lips the
while, as if she were making calculations. There was no carpet on this
last flight of stairs, but the boards were well washed, and the attic
itself smelt sweet and clean.</p>

<p>"This is it," Ethel explained. "Mr. Brock is in the other, next door.
There's only two of them. This is the biggest room, but the other is
north, and has the biggest window, and being in Art, he's got to think
of the light. If you look out there to the right, you'll see some green
in the Park. You'll like the Park. It's no distance if you're a walker.
Now, just let's see. I've been calculating about the money. Mr. Brock
pays fourteen shillings, but you'll not be able to afford more than
seven out of a pound. You shall have it for seven."</p>

<p>"But surely that will be a loss to you!" Beth exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ethel sat herself down on the side of the bed and smiled up at her.
"I'll not pretend we couldn't get more if we waited," she said; "but
waiting's a loss, and we're doing very well downstairs, and can afford
to pick and choose. You'll find in business that it pays better in the
end to get a good tenant you can trust, who'll stay, than one who gives
you double the amount for a month, and then goes off with the blankets."</p>

<p>"You don't deceive me a bit," said Beth, sitting down opposite to her on
a cane-bottomed chair. "Your good-heartedness shines out of your face.
But I'm not going to take a mean advantage of it. There's an honest
atmosphere in this house that would suit me, I feel, and I am sure I
shall do well here; but all the same I won't come unless you make a
bargain with me. If I take the rooms for such a small sum now, while I
am poor, will you let me make it up to you when I succeed? I shall
succeed!" The last words burst from her involuntarily, forced from her
with emphasis in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"That's what <i>I</i> like to hear; that's spirit, that is!" Ethel Maud Mary
exclaimed, nodding approvingly. "You'll do all right. So it's a bargain.
Washing's included, you know. You didn't bring your box, did you?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I left my luggage at Charing Cross when I arrived last night. I
slept at the hotel," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"At the Charing Cross Hotel? Gracious! that must have cost you a small
fortune."</p>

<p>"I didn't know what to do," Beth explained apologetically.</p>

<p>"You should have tried the Strand, Surrey Street, and there. You'd have
got bed and breakfast for five shillings, and that's more than enough.
However, it's no use crying over spilt milk. You'll have to fetch your
luggage, I suppose. You can go by train from Nottinghill Gate to Charing
Cross. It's about as cheap as the 'bus, and much quicker. I'll come with
you, and show you the way, if you like. A breath of fresh air will do me
good."</p>

<p>"Yes, do come," Beth answered gratefully, glad of the kindly human
fellowship. "What is your name, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Ethel Maud Mary Gill; and what is yours, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Elizabeth Caldwell Maclure."</p>

<p>Beth had emptied her secret chamber and packed all her little
possessions before she left Slane. She had sometimes suspected that Dan
would be glad of an excuse to get rid of her, to relieve himself of the
cost of her keep; and that he would do it in some gross way, and so as
to put all the blame of it upon her, if possible, she also expected. She
was therefore prepared to consider the matter settled the moment he
threatened her, and would have felt it useless to remonstrate even had
she been inclined. But she was not inclined. She had for years done
everything patiently that any one in any code of morality could expect
of her in such a marriage, and no good had come of it. As Daniel Maclure
was, so would he remain for ever; and to associate with him intimately
without being coarsened and corrupted was impossible. Beth had fought
hard against that, and had suffered in the struggle; but she had been
lowered in spite of herself, and she knew it, and resented it. She was
therefore as glad to leave Maclure as he was to get rid of her; and
already it seemed as if with her married life a great hampering weight
had fallen from her, and left her free to face a promising future with
nothing to fear and everything to hope. Poverty was pleasant in her big
bright attic, where all was clean and neat about her. There she could
live serenely, and purify her mind by degrees of the garbage with which
Dan's habitual conversation had polluted it.</p>

<p>The settling-in occupied her for some days, and the housekeeping was a
puzzle when she first began. She had only been able to bring the most
precious of her possessions, her books and papers, and clothes enough
for the moment, away with her from Slane; the rest she had left ready
packed to be sent to her when she should be settled. When she wrote to
Maclure for them, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
 sent him some housekeeping keys she had forgotten
to leave behind, and an inventory of everything she had had charge of,
which she had always kept carefully checked. He acknowledged the receipt
of this letter, and informed her that he had gone over the inventory
himself, and found some of the linen in a bad state and one silver
teaspoon missing. Beth replied that the linen had been fairly worn out,
but she could not account for the missing spoon, and offered to pay for
it. Dr. Maclure replied by return of post on a post-card that the price
was seven shillings. Beth sent him a postal order for that amount. He
then wrote to say that the cost of the conveyance of the luggage to the
station was half-a-crown. Beth sent him half-a-crown, and then the
correspondence ended. She received letters from some of her relations,
however, to whom Maclure had hastened to send his version of the story.
Poor old Aunt Grace Mary was the only one, who did not accept it. "Write
and tell me the truth of the matter, my dear," she said. The others took
it for granted that Beth could have nothing to say for herself, and her
brother Jim was especially indignant and insulting, his opinion of her
being couched in the most offensive language. Having lived with
disreputable women all his life, he had the lowest possible opinion of
the whole sex, his idea being that any woman would misconduct herself if
she had the chance and was not well watched. He warned Beth not to apply
to him if she should be starving, or to claim his acquaintance should
she meet him in the street. Beth's cheeks burned with shame when she
read this letter and some of the others she received, and she hastened
to destroy them; but the horror they set up in her brought on a nervous
crisis such as she had suffered from in the early days when Dan first
brought her down to his own low level of vice and suspicion, and turned
her deadly sick. She answered none of these letters, and, by dint of
resolutely banishing all thought of them and of the writers, she managed
in time to obliterate the impression; but she had to live through some
terrible hours before she succeeded.</p>

<p>Once settled in her attic home, she returned to the healthy, regular,
industrious habits which had helped her so much in the days when she had
been at her best. Her life was of the simplest, but she had to do almost
everything for herself, such time as Gwendolen could command for
attendance being wholly insufficient to keep the attic in order. Her
daily duties kept her in health, however, by preventing indolence either
of mind or body, and so were of infinite use. She had added a few things
to the scanty furniture of her attic&mdash;a new bath, a second-hand
writing-table, book-shelves with a cupboard beneath for cups, saucers,
and glasses, and a grandfather chair&mdash;all great bargains, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span> Ethel Maud
Mary assured her. Ethel Maud Mary's kindness was inexhaustible. She took
Beth to the second-hand shop herself, and showed her that the
writing-table and book-shelves would be as good as new when they were
washed and rubbed up a bit; and all the grandfather chair wanted was a
new cretonne cover at sixpence a yard&mdash;four yards, two shillings, and
she could make it herself. She also advised Beth to buy a little
oil-stove, the only one she knew of that really didn't smell if you
attended to it yourself; and a tin to hold oil for it&mdash;crystal oil at
sevenpence a gallon, the best.</p>

<p>"You can do all you want with that, and keep yourself warm enough too
when the weather's bad," she said; "and there's no waste, for you can
turn it out when you've done with it. Fires are too dear for you at
sixpence a scuttle for coals, and they're dirtier besides, and a trouble
to light and look after. You'll find it as good as a lamp, too, if
you're doing nothing particular at night."</p>

<p>When Beth had made a cosy corner of the window for work, arranged her
books, put her ornaments about on mantelpiece and brackets, hung her
pictures and the draperies she had used in her secret chamber, spread
the rugs and covered the grandfather chair, her attic looked inviting.
The character of her little possessions gave the poor place a
distinction which enchanted Ethel Maud Mary.</p>

<p>Beth fetched up the water overnight for her bath in the morning, and
made coffee for her breakfast on the little oil-stove. She lived
principally on bread and butter, eggs, sardines, salad, and slices of
various meats bought at a cook-shop and carried home in a paper.
Sometimes, when she felt she could afford it, she had a hot meal at an
eating-house for the good of her health; but she scarcely required it,
for she never felt stronger in her life, and so long as she could get
good coffee for her breakfast and tea for her evening meal, she missed
none of the other things to which she had been accustomed. She made
delicious coffee in a tin coffee-pot, and brewed the best tea she had
ever drunk in brown earthenware, which Ethel Maud Mary considered the
best thing going for tea. She used to join Beth in a cup up in the
attic, but she never came empty-handed. Dull wet days, likely to be
depressing, were the ones on which her yellow head appeared oftenest at
the top of the attic stairs.</p>

<p>"Miss Maclure, may I come in?" she would say, after knocking.</p>

<p>And Beth would answer, rising from her work with a smile of welcome,
"Yes, by all means. I'm delighted to see you. You take the big chair and
I'll make the tea. I'm dying for a cup."</p>

<p>Then Ethel Maud Mary would uncover something she held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span> in her hand,
which would prove to be cakes, or hot buttered toast and watercresses,
or a bag of shrimps and some thin bread and butter; and Beth, sparkling
at the kindness, would exclaim, "I never was so spoilt in my life!" to
which Ethel Maud Mary would rejoin, "There'll not be much to boast about
between two of us."</p>

<p>Beth was busy with another book by this time, but found the work more of
a task and less of a pleasure than it used to be. Ethel Maud Mary still
took it for granted that she was a journalist, and showed no interest in
her work beyond hoping that she got her pay regularly, and would soon be
making more. Beth wondered sometimes when the little book which had been
accepted in the summer would appear, and what she would get for it, if
anything, and she thought of inquiring, but she put it off. Her new work
took all her time and strength, and wearied her, so that nothing else
seem to signify.</p>

<p>Besides Ethel Maud Mary and Gwendolen, the only person she had to talk
to was Arthur Milbank Brock, the young American, her neighbour in the
next attic. She met him coming upstairs with his hat in his hand soon
after her instalment, and was even more attracted by his face than she
had been when she first saw him in the street.</p>

<p>"You've settled in by this time, I hope," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, and very comfortably too, thanks to you," Beth answered.</p>

<p>"Ah, Ethel Maud Mary's a good sort," he replied, "golden hair, blue
eyes, and all. She has the looks of a lady's novel and the heart of a
holy mother. Her grammar and spelling are defective, but her sense is
sound. I wouldn't give much for her opinion of a work of art, but I'd
take her advice in a difficulty if it came anywhere within range of her
experience. She knows this world well, but picks her steps through it in
such a way that I guess she'll reach the threshold of the next with nice
clean shoes."</p>

<p>He stepped aside for Beth to pass when he had spoken, and stood a moment
watching her thoughtfully as she descended. "And may you too," he said
to himself as he turned to go up, then, perceiving that the hope implied
a doubt, he began to wonder whence it came.</p>

<p>As Beth went out, she reflected on his face, on a certain gravity which
heightened its refinement. It was a young face, but worn, as by some
past trial or present care, and with an habitually sober expression
which contrasted notably with the cheery humour of his speech, adding
point to it, as is frequently the case with his countrymen. He wore his
thick brown hair rather longer than is usual, but was clean shaven. His
features
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
 were delicate and regular, his eyes deep and dark, his head
large and finely formed. In figure he was tall and slim, and in his
whole appearance there was something almost ethereal, as of a young poet
or philosopher still moving among his fellow-men, yet knowing himself to
be prematurely smitten, set apart, and consecrated to death, by some
insidious slow disease from which there is no escape. This was Beth's
first notion of him, but she always hoped it was fanciful. She thought
about him a good deal in the solitary walks which were her principal
recreation. When she was tired of working or wanted to think, she used
to go out and wander alone. At first she was afraid to venture far, for
she had always been assured that she had no head for topography, and
would never be able to find her way; and so long as she went about under
escort, with some one to save her the necessity of observing, she never
knew where she was. Now, however, that she had to look after herself,
she found no difficulty after her first timidity wore off; and this
little experience taught her why it is that the intelligence of women
seems childishly defective as regards many of the details of the
business of life. They have the faculty, but when they are not allowed
to act for themselves, it remains imperfectly developed or is altogether
atrophied for want of exercise.</p>

<p>It was in these days of peace that the ugly downward droop of the
corners of Beth's mouth, which had always spoilt the expression of her
face, entirely disappeared, and her firm-set lips softened into keeping
with the kindliness of her beautiful grey eyes; but she still wanted
much loving to bring out the natural tenderness which had been so often
and so cruelly nipped back in its growth. Beth had been born to be a
woman, but circumstances had been forcing her to become a career.
Strangely enough, some of the scenes she saw during her rambles in
London helped to soften her. While she was under her husband's
influence, she saw the evil only, and was filled with bitterness. London
meant for her in those days the dirt and squalor of the poor, the
depravity of the rich, the fiendish triumph of the lust of man, and the
horrible degradation of her own sex; but now that her mind was
recovering its tone, and she could see with her own eyes, she discovered
the good at war with the evil, the courage and kindliness of the poor,
signs of the growth of better feeling in the selfish and greedy rich,
the mighty power of purity at war with the license of man, and the noble
attitude of women wherever injustice was rife, the weak oppressed, and
the wronged remained unrighted; then her heart expanded with pity, and
instead of the torment of unavailing hate, she began to revive in the
glow of strengthening gleams of hope. It was in those days too that she
learnt to appreciate the wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
 and beauty of the most wonderful and
beautiful city ever seen; and her eyes grew deep from long looking and
earnest meditating upon it. She occasionally experienced the sickening
sensation of being followed about by one of those specimens of mankind
so significantly called "sly dogs" by their fellow-men. They made
themselves particularly objectionable in Kensington Gardens and Hyde
Park; but she found that an appeal to a policeman or a Park-keeper, or
to any decent workman, was enough to stop the nuisance. Genuine respect
for women, which is an antidote to the moral rottenness that promotes
the decay of nations, and portends the indefinite prolongation of the
life of a race, is of slow growth, but it is steadily increasing among
the English-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>During her rambles, Beth composed long letters to her friends, but
somehow none of them were ever written. She had managed to send a few
hurried lines of explanation to Mrs. Kilroy in the midst of her packing
before she left Slane. As she had not known where she would be, she had
asked Angelica to address her letters to Slane to be forwarded; but no
reply had come as yet, and Beth was just a little sore and puzzled about
it. However, she knew that, what with her public and private duties,
Angelica was overwhelmed with work, and might well have overlooked the
fact that she had not answered Beth's letter, so Beth determined to
write again. Time passed, however, and she got into such a groove of
daily duties that anything outside the regular routine required a
special effort which she always postponed, and letters were quite
outside the regular routine. After the first no one wrote to her except
the old lawyer who sent her half-yearly dividend; and she had written to
no one. She had dropped altogether out of her own world, yet, because of
her work and of her power to interest herself in every one about her,
and to appreciate the goodness of her humblest friends, her life was
full, and she had not known a moment's discontent. Little things were
great pleasures now. To be able to get on the top of an omnibus at
Piccadilly Circus when the sun was setting, and ride to Hammersmith
Broadway, engrossed in watching the wonderful narrow cloudscape above
the streets, changing from moment to moment in form and colour; the
mystery of the hazy distances, the impression of the great buildings and
tall irregular blocks of houses appearing all massed together among the
trees from different points of view, and taking on fine architectural
effects, now transformed into huge grey palaces, large and distinct, now
looming in the mist, sketchily, with uncertain outlines, and all the
fascination of the fabrics, innocent of detail, that confront the
dreamer in enchanted woods, or lure him to the edge of fairy lakes with
twinkling lights all multiplied by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
 own reflection in the water.
Beth had rolled in that direction in luxurious carriages often, and
never joyed in the scene, her mind being set on other things&mdash;things
prosaic, such as what she should wear, or whether she was late, scraps
of society gossip, conversations which had satiated without satisfying
her, and remained in her mind to be items of weariness if not of actual
irritation. She had noticed in those days how very seldom she saw a
happy face in a carriage, unless it was a very young face, full of
expectation. Even the very coachmen and footmen in the Park looked
enervated, as the long lines of carriages passed in wearisome
procession. And in everything there had been that excess which leaves no
room for healthy desire. At first, the shop windows, set out with
tasteless profusion, no article in the heterogeneous masses telling,
however beautiful, each being eclipsed by the other in the horrible
glut, had interested her, and she had looked at everything. But she soon
sickened at the sight. The vast quantities of things, crowded together,
robbed her of all pleasure of choice, and made her feel as if she had
eaten too much. Occasionally she would see two or three things of beauty
displayed with art in a large window; but everywhere else excessive
quantity produced indifference, disgust, or satiety, according to the
mood of the moment. And even in the days of her poverty and obscurity,
when her faculties were sharpened into proper appreciation by privation,
those congested windows teeming with jewels, with wearing apparel, with
all things immoderately, set up a sort of mental dyspepsia that was
distressing, and she was glad to turn away to relieve the consequent
brain-fag. But by degrees she became accustomed to the tasteless
profusion. It did not please her any better, but at all events it did
not afflict her by always obtruding itself upon her attention. She saw
it, not in detail, but as a part of the picture; and she found in the
new view of London and of London life from the top of omnibuses more of
the unexpected, of delight, of beauty for the eyes and of matter for the
mind, of humour, pathos, poetry, of tragedy and comedy, suggestive
glimpses caught in passing and vividly recollected, than she could have
conceived possible when she rolled along with society on carriage
cushions, soothed by the stultifying ease into temporary sensuous
apathy.</p>

<p>Winter set in suddenly and with terrible severity that year. London
became a city of snow, cruelly cold, but beautiful, all its ugliness
disguised by the white mantle, all its angles softened, all its charms
enhanced. Commonplace squares, parks, gardens, and dirty streets were
transformed into fairyland by the delicate disposition of snow in
festoons on door-post and railing, ledge and lintel, from roof to
cellar. The trees especially, all frosted with shining filigree, were a
wonder to look upon; and Beth would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
 wander about the alleys in
Kensington Gardens, and gaze at the glory of the white world under the
sombre grey of the murky clouds, piled up in awesome magnificence, until
she ached with yearning for some word of human speech, some way to
express it, to make it manifest.</p>

<p>She returned one afternoon somewhat wet and weary from one of her
rambles. The little window of her attic was half snowed up, and the
gloom under the sloping roof struck a chill to her heart as she entered;
but when she had lighted the lamp (a new investment that helped up the
temperature besides giving light), and set her little oil-stove going
with the kettle on it, her surroundings took on an air of homely comfort
that was grateful. As she busied herself preparing the tea, she noticed
that her neighbour in the next attic was coughing a good deal, and then
it occurred to her that she had not seen him about lately, and she
wondered if he could be ill. The thought of a young man of small means,
ill alone in a London lodging, probably without a bell in the room, and
certainly with no one anxious to answer it if he should ring, though not
cheering, is stimulating to the energy of the benevolent, and Beth went
downstairs to ask as soon as the notion occurred to her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brock? there now!" Gwendolen exclaimed in dismay. "If I didn't
forget altogether! I've so much to see to, and the missus ill in bed
with bronchitis, and Miss Ethel run off her feet, and not too fit
'erself with that cold as 'ud be called influenza if it wasn't for
frightening the lodgers. Whatever it is, it's going through the 'ouse,
and Mr. Brock seems to have got it bad. 'E ast me when I went wiv 'is
shyving-water this morning to tike 'im some coals and mike 'im some tea,
an' I never thought no more about it&mdash;I clean forgot."</p>

<p>"This morning!" Beth cried. "Why that was at eight o'clock, and now it
is four!"</p>

<p>"I'll get 'em at once," Gwendolen said with contrition. But the girl
herself looked worn to death. She had been on her feet since early
morning, and had no prospect of a rest till she dropped on her bed late
at night, too exhausted to undress.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Beth said. "Give me the coals, and I'll carry them up, and
see to the rest. I have nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"Bless you," Gwendolen muttered.</p>

<p>Beth found Mr. Brock in bed, with bright eyes, and burning spots of
colour on each cheek. A lamp was burning beside him. When he saw who it
was, he raised his eyebrows; but smiled at the same time, as if he were
both surprised and pleased. The room struck cold to Beth.</p>

<p>"What! no fire?" she exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tried to light the pesky thing," he said, "but it wouldn't burn."</p>

<p>"Gwendolen forgot you altogether," Beth said. "She has far too much to
do, poor girl, and I have only just heard that you were ill. Why didn't
you call me?"</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>"We are all of the same family here, you know," Beth said, "the great
human family. You had only to say 'Sister!' and I should have come."</p>

<p>The smile faded from his lips, but it was replaced by another
expression, which, when she saw it, caused Beth to ejaculate inwardly,
"Surely of such are the Kingdom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Each had seen in the other's face at the same time something there is no
human utterance to describe, and, recognising it, had reverently held
their peace.</p>

<p>Beth fetched her oil-stove first, with the kettle on it, and, while the
water was boiling, she cut bread and butter and lighted the fire.</p>

<p>"We'll have tea together, if you please," she said cheerfully. "I've a
horrible suspicion that you've had nothing to eat or drink all day."</p>

<p>Her sympathy recalled his pleasant, patient smile.</p>

<p>"My appetite is not devouring," he said, "but my thirst is. Talk about
selling one's birthright! I'd sell my brains, I believe, for a cup of
tea at this moment."</p>

<p>"There's a bowl full for nothing, then," Beth rejoined. "Sip it while I
boil you an egg."</p>

<p>He took the bowl in both hands and tried the tea.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed with a long-drawn sigh, "it's nectar! it's mead! it's
nepenthe! it's all the drinks ever brewed for all the gods in one! But
I'm afraid to touch it lest I should finish it."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, then," said Beth, "for you'll find it like liquor for
the gods in another respect; it will be to be had whenever you want it.
What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Did I make lament?" he asked. "I didn't know it. But I'm all one ache.
I can't lie still for it, and I can't move without adding to it. I've
been watching the ice-floes on the river from the Embankment and bridges
by all lights lately; I never saw finer effects&mdash;such colour! It's
wonderful what colour there is under your sombre sky if you know how to
look for it; and it has the great advantage over the colour other
countries teem with of being unexpected. It's not obvious; you have to
look out for it; but when you have found it, you rejoice in it as in
something rare and precious, and it excites you to enthusiasm beyond
your wont&mdash;which should prevent chills, but it doesn't, as witness my
aches."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth felt his hand and found it dry and burning.</p>

<p>"The doctor is the next and only thing for you, young man, after this
frugal meal," she said, "and I'll go and fetch him. I hope to goodness
these are the right things to give you."</p>

<p>He objected to the doctor, but she paid no attention to his
remonstrance, and when she had done all she could think of for the
moment, she put on her wet boots and walking things again, got the
address of a good man from Ethel Maud Mary, and sallied out into the
snow once more.</p>

<p>Rheumatic fever was the doctor's diagnosis, and his directions to Beth
concluded with a long list of expensive medical comforts which it seemed
were absolutely necessary. She went out again when he had gone, and
brought back everything, toiling up the long flights of stairs with both
arms full, breathless but cheerful; and having set all in order for
use&mdash;sheets of medicated cotton-wool, medicines, Valentine's extract,
clinical thermometer and chart&mdash;she settled herself to watch the
patient, the clock, and the temperature of the room, which had to be
equable, with the exactness and method of a capable nurse. Before the
household retired, she went downstairs to fetch more coals, fearing they
might run short in the night.</p>

<p>"He's 'ad one scuttle to-day," Gwendolen reminded her, warningly.</p>

<p>"He must have two more, then, if necessary," said Beth.</p>

<p>"They're sixpence a scuttle, you know," Gwendolen remonstrated.</p>

<p>"Two for a shilling, and no charge for delivery," said Beth as she
toiled up the long ascent once more with her heavy burden.</p>

<p>"Eh! it would be a gay glad world if they all took it like you,"
Gwendolen muttered, as she stood, with the pencil in her mouth, studying
the slate that hung outside the coal-cellar, and let her generosity war
with her accuracy and honesty for a little before she made two more
strokes on the line that began with the name of Brock; and no sooner
done than regretted.</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness I'd put 'em down to old Piggot and Mother Hauseman,"
she thought. "They'd never miss the money, and it 'ud be a good deed for
the likes of them to help their betters, and might likely profit their
own souls, though unbeknown."</p>

<p>For many weeks Beth watched beside the sick man's bed, doing all that
was possible to ease his pain day and night, snatching brief intervals
of rest when she could, and concealing her weariness at all times. She
used to wonder at the young man's uncomplaining fortitude, his
gentleness, gratitude, and unselfish concern about her fatigue. Even
when he was at his worst, he would struggle back to consciousness in
order to entreat her to lie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
 down; and when, to please him, she had
settled herself on a little couch there was in his room, he would make a
superhuman effort to keep still as long as his flickering consciousness
lasted. There was only one thing he was ever exacting about&mdash;to keep her
in sight. So long as he could see her he was satisfied, and would lie
for hours, patiently controlling himself for fear of disturbing her by
uttering exclamations or making other signs of suffering; but when she
had to leave him alone, he broke down and moaned in his weakness and
pain for her to come back and help him.</p>

<p>The doctor having declared that the north-east aspect of his attic was
all against the patient, Beth insisted on changing with him, and, as
soon as he could be moved, she, Ethel Maud Mary, and Gwendolen, with the
doctor's help, carried him into her room in a sheet; an awkward
man&oelig;uvre because of his length, which made it hard to turn him on the
narrow landing; his weight was nothing, for he was mere skin and bone by
that time&mdash;all eyes, as Beth used to tell him.</p>

<p>It was Christmas Eve when they moved him, and late that night Beth kept
her vigil by him, sitting over the fire with her elbows on her knees and
her face between her hands, listening dreamily to the clang and clamour
of the church-bells, which floated up to her over the snow, mellowed by
distance and full-fraught with manifold associations. As she sat there
she pondered. She thought of the long way she had drifted from the days
when she knelt in spirit at the call of the bells and lost herself in
happy prayer. She thought of her husband's hypocrisy, and the way in
which, when it dawned upon her, her own faith had melted from her; and
she pondered on the difference it would have made if only she had been
married early&mdash;just to a good man. It would not have been necessary for
her to have loved him&mdash;not with passion&mdash;only to have relied upon him.
Some one to trust, she craved for, more than some one to love; yet she
allowed that a loveless marriage is a mock marriage. She did not regret
the loss of her conventional faith, but she wished she could join the
congregation just for the human fellowship. She felt the need of union,
of some central station, a centre of peace, unlike the church, the house
of disunion. Without knowing it, she leant to Quaker-Catholicism, the
name assumed for her religious principles by Caroline
Fox&mdash;Quaker-Catholicism having direct spiritual teaching for its
distinctive dogma.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" Arthur Brock said suddenly from the bed.</p>

<p>Beth started. She thought he was asleep.</p>

<p>"God," she said; with a gasp, "and going to church," she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span> added,
laughing at her own abruptness. "I was wanting a church to go to."</p>

<p>"You don't belong to the Established Church, then," he said. "Well, I
don't go to church myself; but I make a difference on Sundays. I don't
work, and I read another kind of book. It is my day for the plains of
heaven. I should like to be there all the time, if I could manage it;
but I can't, not being a monk in a cell. When I can, I make the ascent,
however, with the help of the books that take one there."</p>

<p>"I used to read religious books too," said Beth; "but I found little
illumination in them, most of them being but the dry husks of the
subject, uninformed of the spirit, containing no vital spark, and
stained with blood."</p>

<p>"How?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"This God of the Hebrews," Beth began, looking dreamily into the fire,
"what is his history? He loved cruelty and bloodshed. The innocent
animals first suffered in his service; but, not content with that, he
went from bad to worse, as men do, and ended by demanding human
sacrifice, the sacrifice of his own son. And for that specially we are
required to adore him, although it must be clear to the commonest
capacity to-day that the worship of such a deity is devil-worship. I do
not say there is no God; I only say this is not God&mdash;this blood-lover,
this son-slayer, this blind omniscience, this impotent omnipotence, this
merciful cruelty, this meek arrogance, this peaceful combatant; this is
not God, but man. The mind of man wars with the works of God to mar
them. Man tries to make us believe that he is made in the image of God;
but what happened was just the reverse. Man was of a better nature
originally, a more manifold nature. He had intellect for a toy to play
with on earth, and spirit for a power to help him to heaven. But instead
of toiling to strengthen his spirit, he preferred to play with his
intellect; and he played until he became so expert in the use of it, and
so interested in the game, that he forgot his origin. And then it was
that he projected an image of himself into space, and was so delighted
with his own appearance from that point of view, that he called it God
and fell down and worshipped it. If you would understand man, consider
God; if you would know his God, study man."</p>

<p>Arthur Brock reflected for a little.</p>

<p>"What you say sounds real smart," he said at last, "and there's a kind
of glamour in your words that dazzles and prevents one seeing just how
much they mean at first. It is true that religion culminates in human
sacrifice both here and in Africa, and, for refinement of horror, we
have here the literal bloody sacrifice of a son by his father. But that
is not God, as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
 say; that is the ultimate of the priest. And the
priest is the same at all times, in all ages, beneath all veneers of
civilisation. His credit depends upon a pretence to power. He is not a
humble seeker after truth, but a bigoted upholder of error and an
impudent time-server. He destroys the scientific discoverer in one age;
in the next he finds his own existence is threatened because he refuses
to acknowledge that the discoverer was right; then he confesses the
truth, and readjusts his hocus-pocus to suit it. He does not ask us to
pin our faith to fancies which seem real to a child in its infancy, yet
he would have us credulous about those which were the outcome of the
intellectual infancy of the race. What he can't get over in himself is
the absence of any sense of humour. I'm real sorry for him at times, and
I tell him so."</p>

<p>Beth smiled. "I could not be so kindly courteous," she said. "Some
things make me fierce. The kingdom of heaven is or is not within us, I
believe; and half the time I know it is not in me, because there is no
room for anything in me but the hate and rage that rend me for horror of
all the falsehood, injustice, and misery I know of and cannot prevent. A
sense of humour would save the church perhaps; but I'm too sore to see
it. All I can say is: your religion to me is horrifying&mdash;human sacrifice
and devil-worship, survivals from an earlier day welded on to our own
time, and assorting ill with it. I would not accept salvation at the
hands of such futile omnipotence, such cruel mercy, such blood-stained
justice. The sight of suffering was grateful to man when the world was
young, as it still is to savages; but we revolt from it now. We should
not be happy in heaven, as the saved were said to be in the old tales,
within sight of the sinners suffering in hell."</p>

<p>"Which is to say that there is more of Christ in us now than there was
in the days of old," he said, speaking dispassionately, and with the
confident deliberation of one who takes time to think. "I believe those
old tales were founded on muddle-headed confusion of mind in the days
when dreams were as real to mankind as the events of life. There are
obscure tribes still on earth who cannot distinguish between what they
have done and what they have only dreamt they did, and probably every
race has gone through that stage of development. I don't know if
excessive piety be a disease of the nerves, as some say, although what
is piety in one generation does appear to be perversity in the next, as
witness the sons of the clergy, and other children of pious people, who
don't answer to expectation, as a rule. And I don't go much on churches
or creeds, or faith in this personality or that. The old ideas have lost
their hold upon me, as they have upon you; but that is no reason why we
should give up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
 old truths that have been in the world for all time,
the positive right and wrong, which are facts, not ideas. I believe that
there is good and evil, that the one is at war with the other always;
and that good can do no evil, evil no good. I've got beyond all the
dogma and fiddle-faddle of the intellect with which the church has
overlaid the spirit, and all the ceremonial so useful and necessary for
individual souls in early stages of development. I used to think if I
could find a religion with no blood in it, I would embrace it. Now I
feel sure that it does not matter what the expression of our religious
nature is so that it be religious. Religion is an attitude of mind, the
attitude of prayer, which includes reverence for things holy and deep
devotion to them. I would not lose that for anything&mdash;the right of
appeal; but now, when I think of our Father in heaven, I do not despise
our mother on earth."</p>

<p>Beth sat some time looking thoughtfully into the fire. "Go to sleep,"
she said at last, abruptly. "You ought not to be talking at this time of
night."</p>

<p>"I wish you would go to sleep yourself," he said, as he settled himself
obediently; "for I lose half the comfort of being saved, while you sit
up there suffering for me."</p>

<p>The expression was not too strong for the strain Beth had to put upon
herself in those days; for she had no help. Ethel Maud Mary and
Gwendolen felt for her and her patient, as they said; but there of
necessity their kindness ended. The other lodgers kept Gwendolen for
ever running to and fro; each seemed to think she had nobody else to
look after, and it was seldom indeed that any of them noticed her
weariness or took pity on her. Beth did everything for herself, fetched
the coals from the cellar, the water from the bath-room, swept and
dusted, cleaned the grate, ran out to do the shopping, and returned to
do the cooking and mending. Ethel Maud Mary stole the time to run up
occasionally to show sympathy; but her own poor little hands were
overfull, what with her mother ill in bed, both ends to be made to meet,
and lodgers uncertain in money matters. She lost all her plumpness that
winter, her rose-leaf complexion faded to the colour of dingy wax, and
her yellow hair, so brightly burnished when she had time to brush it,
became towzled and dull; but her heart beat as bravely-kind as ever, and
she never gave in.</p>

<p>She climbed up one day in a hurry to Mr. Brock's room, which Beth
occupied, snatching a moment to make inquiries and receive comfort; and
as soon as she entered she subsided suddenly on to a chair out of
breath.</p>

<p>"How you do it a dozen times a day, Miss Maclure, I can't think," she
gasped.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those stairs have taught me what servants suffer," Beth said, as if
that, at all events, were a thing for which to be thankful.</p>

<p>"You'd not have driven 'em, even if you hadn't known what they suffer,"
said Ethel Maud Mary. "That's the worst of this world. All the hard
lessons have got to be learnt by the people who never needed them to
make them good, while the bad folk get off for nothing."</p>

<p>"I don't know about not needing them," said Beth. "But I do know this:
that every sorrowful experience I have ever had has been an advantage to
me sooner or later."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe that Ma's temper would be an advantage to me,"
Ethel Maud Mary said, sighing; "she's that wearing! But there, poor
dear! she's sick, and there's no keeping the worries from her. There's
only you and Mr. Brock in the house just now that pays up to the day, so
you may guess what it is! He's getting on nicely now, I suppose; but you
shouldn't be sitting here in the cold. A shawl don't make the
difference; it's the air you breathe; and you ought to have your
oil-stove going. Isn't the fire enough for him? I can't think so many
degrees it need be in his room always, when there's no degree at all in
yours."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm hardy," said Beth. "I never was better."</p>

<p>"You look it," Ethel Maud Mary said sarcastically, "like a pauper just
out of prison. What are you worrying about?"</p>

<p>"Beef-tea," said Beth. And so she was, and bread and butter, fuel,
light, and lodging&mdash;everything, in fact, that meant money; for the money
was all but done, and she had had a shock on the subject lately that had
shaken her considerably.</p>

<p>She had spread out a newspaper to save the carpet, and was kneeling on
the floor, one morning, in front of the window, cleaning and filling the
little oil-stove, and Arthur was lying contentedly watching
her&mdash;"superintending her domestic duties," he used to call it, that
being all that he was equal to in his extreme weakness just then.</p>

<p>"You're a notable housekeeper," he said. "I shouldn't have expected you
from your appearance to be able to cook and clean as you do."</p>

<p>"I used to do this kind of thing as a child to help a lazy servant we
had, bless her," Beth answered. "The cooking and cleaning she taught me
have stood me in good stead."</p>

<p>"If you had a daughter, how would you bring her up?" he asked.</p>

<p>Beth opened the piece of paper with which she was cleaning the oil off
the stove, and regarded it thoughtfully. "I would bring her up in happy
seclusion, to begin with," she said. "She should have all the joys of
childhood; and then an education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
 calculated to develop all her
intellectual powers without forcing them, and at the same time to fit
her for a thoroughly normal woman's life: childhood, girlhood, wifehood,
motherhood, each with its separate duties and pleasures all complete. I
would have her happy in each, steadfast, prudent, self-possessed,
methodical, economical; and if she had the capacity for any special
achievement, I think that such an education would have developed the
strength of purpose and self-respect necessary to carry it through. I
would also have her to know thoroughly the world that she has to live
in, so that she might be ready to act with discretion in any emergency.
I should, in fact, want to fit her for whatever might befall her, and
then leave her in confidence to shape her own career. The life for a
woman to long for&mdash;and a man too, I think&mdash;is a life of simple duties
and simple pleasures, a normal life; but I only call that life normal
which is suited to the requirements of the woman's individual
temperament."</p>

<p>"You don't clamour for more liberty, then?"</p>

<p>"It depends upon what you mean by that. The cry for more liberty is
sometimes the cry of the cowardly anxious to be excused from their share
of the duties and labours of life; and it is also apt to be a cry not
for liberty but for licence. One must discriminate."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"By the character and principles of the people you have to deal
with&mdash;obviously."</p>

<p>She had lighted her little oil-stove by this time, and set a saucepan of
water on it to boil. Then she fetched a chopping board and a piece of
raw beef-steak, which she proceeded to cut up into dice and put into a
stone jar until it was crammed full. Her sensitive mouth showed some
shrinking from the rawness, and her white fingers were soon dyed red;
but she prepared the meat none the less carefully for that. When the jar
was filled and the contents seasoned, she put it in the pot on the stove
for the heat to extract the juice.</p>

<p>"What is it going to be to-day?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Beef-jelly," she said. "You must be tired of beef-tea."</p>

<p>"I'm tired of nothing you do for me," he rejoined. "This is the homiest
time I've had in England."</p>

<p>Beth smiled. In spite of poverty, anxiety, and fatigue, it was the
"homiest time" she had had since Aunt Victoria's death, and she loved
it. Now that she had some one she could respect and care for dependent
on her, whose every look and word expressed appreciation of her
devotion, the time never hung heavily on her hands, as it used to do in
the married days that had been so long in the living. It was all as
congenial as it was new to her, this close association with a man of the
highest character and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
 most perfect refinement. She had never before
realised that there could be such men, so heroic in suffering, so
unselfish, and so good; and this discovery had stimulated her
strangely&mdash;filled her with hope, strengthened her love of life, and made
everything seem worth while.</p>

<p>She went on with her work in silence after that last remark of his, and
he continued to watch her with all an invalid's interest in the little
details of his narrow life.</p>

<p>"It would be a real relief to me to be able to get up and do all that
for you," he finally observed. "I don't feel much of a man lying here
and letting you work for me."</p>

<p>"This is woman's work," Beth said.</p>

<p>"Woman's work and man's work are just anything they can do for each
other," he rejoined. "I wonder if I should get on any quicker with a
change of treatment. Resignation is generally prescribed for rheumatism,
and a variety of drugs which distract attention from the seat of pain to
other parts of the person, and so relieve the mind. My head is being
racked just now by that last dose I took. I should like to try
Salisbury."</p>

<p>"What is Salisbury?" Beth asked.</p>

<p>"Principally beef and hot water, to begin with," he replied. "You'll
find a little work on the subject among my books."</p>

<p>Beth read the volume, and then said, "You shall try Salisbury. It is
easy enough."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered. "It is easy enough with a nurse like you."</p>

<p>But in order to carry out the treatment some things had to be bought,
and this led to the discovery which was a shock to Beth. Arthur's income
depended principally upon the pictures he sold, and no more money came
in after he fell ill. He had had some by him, but not nearly so much as
he supposed, and it was all gone now, in spite of the utmost economy on
Beth's part. Her own, too, was running short, but she had not troubled
about that, because she still had some of her secret hoard to fall back
upon. She had left it in one of the boxes which were sent on after her
from Slane&mdash;a box which she had not opened until now, when she wanted
the money. The money, however, was not there. She searched and searched,
but in vain; all she found was the little bag that had contained it. She
was stunned by the discovery, and sat on the floor for a little, with
the contents of the box all scattered about her, trying to account for
her loss. Then all at once a vision of Maclure, as she had seen him on
one occasion with the bunch of duplicate keys, peering into her
dress-basket with horrid intentness, flashed before her; but she
banished it resolutely with the inevitable conclusion to which it
pointed. She would not allow her mind to be sullied by such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
suspicion. And as to the money, since it was lost, why should she waste
her time worrying about it? She had better set herself to consider how
to procure some more. She had still some of Arthur Brock's, but that she
kept that she might be able to tell him truthfully that it was not all
done when he asked about it&mdash;a pious fraud which relieved his mind and
kept him from retarding his recovery by attempting to begin work again
before he was fit for it. What money she had of her own would last but a
little longer, and how to get more was the puzzle.</p>

<p>Her evening dresses had been in the box which she had just unpacked, and
while she was still sitting on the floor amongst them cogitating, Ethel
Maud Mary came into the attic out of breath to ask how she was getting
on.</p>

<p>"Why," she exclaimed in admiration of Beth's finery, "you've got some
clothes! They'd fetch something, those frocks, if you sold them."</p>

<p>"Then tell me where to sell them, for money I must have," Beth rejoined
precipitately.</p>

<p>"And it's no use keeping gowns; they only go out of fashion," Ethel Maud
Mary suggested, as if she thought Beth should have an excuse. "Gwendolen
would manage it best. She's great at a bargain; and there's a place not
far from here. I'd begin with the worst, if I was you."</p>

<p>"Advise me, then, there's a dear," said Beth, and Ethel Maud Mary knelt
down beside her, and proceeded to advise.</p>

<p>Only a few shillings was the result of the first transaction; but the
better dresses had good trimmings on them, and real lace, which fetched
something, as Ethel Maud Mary declared it would, if sold separately; so,
with the strictest self-denial, Beth was still able to pay her way and
provide for the sick man's necessities.</p>

<p>From the time she put him on the Salisbury treatment, he suffered less
and began to gain strength; but the weather continued severe, and Beth
suffered a great deal herself from exposure and cold and privations of
all kinds. She used to be so hungry sometimes that she hurried past the
provision shops when she had to go out, lest she should not be able to
resist the temptation to go in and buy good food for herself. If her
sympathy with the poor could have been sharpened, it would have been
that winter by some of the sights she saw. Sometimes she was moved by
pity to wrath and rebellion, as on one occasion when she was passing a
house where there had evidently been a fashionable wedding. The road in
front of the house, and the red cloth which covered the steps and
pavement, were thickly strewed with rice, and on this a band of starving
children had pounced, and were scraping it up with their bony claws of
hands, clutching it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
 from each other, fighting for it, and devouring it
raw, while a supercilious servant looked on as though he were amused.
Beth's heart was wrung by the sight, and she hurried by, cursing the
greedy rich who wallow in luxury while children starve in the streets.</p>

<p>In a squalid road which she had often to cross there was a butcher's
shop, where great sides of good red beef with yellow fat were hung in
the doorway. Coming home one evening after dark, she noticed in front of
her a gaunt little girl who carried a baby on her arm and was dragging a
small child along by the hand. When they came to the butcher's shop,
they stopped to look up at the great sides of beef, and the younger
child stole up to one of them, laid her little hand upon it caressingly,
then kissed it. The butcher came out and ordered them off, and Beth
pursued her way through the mire with tears in her eyes. She had
suffered temptation herself that same evening. She had to pass an
Italian eating-house where she used to go sometimes, before she had any
one depending on her, to have a two-shilling dinner&mdash;a good meal,
decently served. Now, when she was always hungry, this was one of the
places she had to hurry past; but even when she did not look at it, she
thought about it, and was tormented by the desire to go in and eat
enough just for once. Visions of thick soup, and fried fish with
potatoes, and roast beef with salad, whetted an appetite that needed no
whetting, and made her suffer an ache of craving scarcely to be
controlled. That day had been a particularly hungry one. The coffee was
done, every precious tea-leaf she had to husband for Arthur, and the
butter had also to be carefully economised because a good deal was
required for his crisp toast, which was unpalatable without it. Beth
lived principally on the crusts she cut off the toast. When they were
very stale, she steeped them in hot water, and sweetened them with brown
sugar. This mess reminded her of Aunt Victoria's bread-puddings, and the
happy summer when they lived together, and she learnt to sit upright on
Chippendale chairs. She would like to have talked to Arthur of those
tender memories, but she could not trust herself, being weak; the tears
were too near the surface.</p>

<p>That day she had turned against her crusts, even with sugar, and had
felt no hunger until she got out into the air, when an imperious craving
for food seized upon her suddenly, and she made for the Italian
restaurant as if she had been driven. The moment she got inside the
place, however, she recovered her self-possession. She would die of
hunger rather than spend two precious shillings on herself while there
was that poor boy at home, suffering in silence, gratefully content with
the poorest fare she brought him, always making much of all she did.</p>

<p>Beth got no farther than the counter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want something savoury for an invalid," she said.</p>

<p>That evening, for the first time, Arthur sat up by the fire in the
grandfather chair with a blanket round him, and enjoyed a dainty little
feast which had been especially provided, as he understood, in honour of
the event.</p>

<p>"But why won't you have some yourself?" he remonstrated.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," Beth answered, "I went to the Italian restaurant when I
was out."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you?" he said. "That's right. I wish you would go every day,
and have a good hot meal. Will you promise me?"</p>

<p>"I'll go every day that I possibly can," Beth answered, smiling brightly
as she saw him fall-to contentedly with the appetite of a thriving
convalescent. Practising pious frauds upon him had become a confirmed
habit by this time&mdash;of which she should have been ashamed; but instead,
she felt a satisfying sense of artistic accomplishment when they
answered, and was only otherwise affected with a certain wonderment at
the very slight and subtle difference there is between truth and
falsehood as conveyed by the turn of a phrase.</p>

<p>But now the money ran shorter and shorter; she had nothing much left to
sell; and it was a question whether she could possibly hold out until
her half-year's dividend was due. Perhaps the old lawyer would let her
anticipate it for once. She wrote and asked him, but while she was
waiting for a reply the pressure became acute.</p>

<p>Out of doors one day, walking along dejectedly, wondering what she
should do when she came to her last shilling, her eye rested on a
placard in the window of a fashionable hairdresser's shop, and she read
mechanically: "<span class="smcap">A GOOD PRICE GIVEN FOR FINE HAIR</span>." She passed on,
however, and was half-way down the street before it occurred to her that
her own hair was of the finest; but the moment she thought of it, she
turned back, and walked into the hairdresser's shop in a business-like
way without hesitation. A gentleman was sitting beside the counter at
one end of the shop, waiting to be attended on; Beth took a seat at the
other end, and waited too. She sat there, deep in thought and
motionless, until she was roused by somebody saying, "What can I do for
you, miss?"</p>

<p>Then she looked up and saw the proprietor, a man with a kindly face.</p>

<p>"Can I speak to you for a moment?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Come this way, if you please," he replied, after a glance at her glossy
dark-brown hair and shabby gloves.</p>

<p>When she went in that day, Arthur uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you've had your hair cut short?" he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span> asked, speaking
to her almost roughly. "Are you going to join the unsexed crew that
shriek on platforms?"</p>

<p>"I don't know any unsexed crew that shriek on platforms," she answered,
"and I am surprised to hear you taking the tone of cheap journalism.
There has been nothing in the woman movement to unsex women except the
brutalities of the men who oppose them."</p>

<p>He coloured somewhat, but said no more&mdash;only sat looking into the fire
with an expression on his face that cut Beth to the quick. It was the
first cloud that had come to overshadow the perfect sympathy of their
intercourse. She was getting his tea at the moment, and, when it was
ready, she put it beside him and retired to his attic, which she
occupied, and looked at herself in the glass for the first time since
she had sacrificed her pretty hair. At the first glance, she laughed;
then her eyes filled with tears, and she threw herself on the bed and
sobbed silently&mdash;not because she regretted her hair, but because he was
hurt, and for once she had no comfort to give him.</p>

<p>Just after she left him, an artist friend of his, Gresham Powell, came
in casually to look him up, and was surprised to find he had been so
ill.</p>

<p>"I missed you about," he said, "but I thought you had shut yourself up
to work. Who's been looking after you?"</p>

<p>Brock gave him the history of his illness.</p>

<p>Powell shook his head when he heard of Beth's devotion.</p>

<p>"Take care, my boy," he said. "The girls you find knocking about town in
these sort of places are not desirable associates for a promising young
man. They're worse than the regular bad ones&mdash;more likely to trap you,
you know, especially when you're shorn of your strength and have good
reason to be grateful. You might think you were rewarding her by
marrying her; but you'll find your mistake. Look at Simpson! Could a man
have done a girl a worse turn than he did when he married Florrie Crone?
They haven't a thought in common except when he's ill and she nurses
him; but a man can't be always getting ill in order to keep in touch
with his wife. I don't know, of course, what this girl's like; but half
of them are adventuresses bent on marrying gentlemen. Is she a
clergyman's daughter, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her but her name," Brock answered coldly. "She has
never tried to excite sympathy in any way."</p>

<p>"Well, they are of all kinds, of course," said Powell temperately. "But
you'd better break away in any case. Nothing will set you up so soon as
a change. Come with me. I'm going into the country to see the spring
come in, and the fruit trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
 flower, and to hear the nightingales. I
know a lovely spot. Come!"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it, and let you know," Arthur Brock answered to get
rid of him.</p>

<p>When he had gone Beth appeared. To please Arthur, she had covered her
cropped head with a white muslin mob-cap bound round with a pale pink
ribbon, and put on a high ruffle and a large white apron, in which she
looked pretty and prim, like a sweet little Puritan, in spite of the
pale pink vanity; and Arthur smiled when he saw her, but afterwards
grumbled: "Why did you cut your pretty hair off? I shouldn't have
thought you could do such a tasteless thing."</p>

<p>Beth knelt down beside his chair to mend the fire, and then she began to
tidy the hearth.</p>

<p>"Am I not the same person?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, not quite," he answered. "You have set up a doubt where all was
settled certainty."</p>

<p>She had taken off the gloves she wore to do the grate, and was about to
pull herself up from her knees by the arm of his chair when he spoke,
but paused to ponder his words. It was with her left hand that she had
grasped the arm of his chair, and he happened to notice it particularly
as it rested there.</p>

<p>"You wear a wedding-ring, I see," he remarked. "Do you find it a
protection?"</p>

<p>"I never looked at it in that light," she answered. "In this vale of
tears I have a husband. That is why I wear it."</p>

<p>There was a perceptible pause, then he asked with an effort, "Where is
your husband?"</p>

<p>"At home, I suppose," said Beth, her voice growing strident with dislike
of the subject. "We do not correspond. He wishes to divorce me."</p>

<p>"And what shall you do if he tries?" Brock asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she replied, and was for leaving him to draw his own
conclusions, but changed her mind. "Shall I tell you the story," she
said after a while.</p>

<p>"No, don't tell me," he rejoined quickly. "Your past is nothing to me.
Nothing that you may have done, and nothing that you may yet do, can
alter my feeling&mdash;my respect for you. As I have known you, so will you
always be to me&mdash;the sweetest, kindest friend I ever had, the best woman
I ever knew."</p>

<p>Men are monotonous creatures. Given a position, and ninety-nine out of a
hundred will come to the same conclusion about it, only by diverse
methods, according to their prejudices; and this is especially the case
when women are in question. Woman is generally out of focus in the mind
of man; he sees her less as she is than as she ought or ought not to be.
Beth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
 did not thank Arthur Brock for his magnanimity. The fact that he
should shrink from hearing the story bespoke a doubt that made his
generous expression an offence. It may be kind to ignore the past of a
guilty person, but the innocent ask to be heard and judged; and full
faith has no fear of revelations.</p>

<p>Beth rose from her knees, and began to prepare the invalid's evening
meal in silence. Usually they chattered like children the whole time,
but that evening they were both constrained. One of those subtle
changes, so common in the relations of men and women, had set in
suddenly since the morning; they were not as they had been with each
other, nor could they continue together as they were; there must be a
readjustment, which was in preparation during the pause.</p>

<p>"You have heard me speak of Gresham Powell?" Brock began at last. "He
was here this afternoon. He thinks I had better go away with him into
the country for a change as soon as I can manage it."</p>

<p>"It is a good idea," said Beth&mdash;"inland of course, not near the sea with
your rheumatism. I will get your things ready at once."</p>

<p>This immediate acquiescence depressed him. He played with his supper a
little, pretending to eat it, then forgot it, and sat looking sadly into
the fire. Beth watched him furtively, but once he caught her gazing at
him with concern.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked, with an effort to be cheerful.</p>

<p>"The matter is the pained expression in your eyes," she answered. "Are
you suffering again?"</p>

<p>"Just twinges," he said, then set his firm full lips, resolute to play
the man.</p>

<p>But the twinges were mental, not bodily, and Beth understood. Their
happy days were done, and there was nothing to be said. They must each
go their own way now, and the sooner the better. Fortunately the old
lawyer had consented without demur to let Beth have her half-year's
dividend in advance, so that there was money for Arthur. He expressed
some surprise that there should be, but took what she gave him without
suspicion, and did not count it. He was careless in money matters, and
had forgotten what he had had when he was taken ill.</p>

<p>"You're a great manager," he said to Beth. "But I suppose you haven't
paid up everything. You must let me know. It <i>will</i> be good to be at
work again!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Beth answered; "but don't worry about it. You won't want money
before you are well able to make it."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew for certain that you would go somewhere yourself to see
the spring come in," he said, looking at her wistfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>"All in good time," she answered in her sprightliest way.</p>

<p>When the last morning came, Beth attended to her usual duties
methodically. She had made every arrangement for him, packed the things
he was to take, and put away those that were to be left behind. When the
cab was called, she went downstairs with him, and stood with Ethel Maud
Mary and Gwendolen on the doorstep in the spring sunshine, smiling and
waving her hand to him as he drove off. Her last words to him were, "You
will go home before we meet again. Give my love to America&mdash;and may she
send us many more such men," Beth added under her breath.</p>

<p>"Amen!" Ethel Maud Mary and Gwendolen echoed.</p>

<p>When the cab was out of sight, Beth turned and went into the house,
walking wearily. At the foot of the stairs she looked up as if she were
calculating the distance; then she began the long ascent with the help
of the banisters, counting each step she took mechanically. The attic
seemed strangely big and bare when she entered it&mdash;it was as if
something had been taken away and left a great gap. There was something
crude and garish about the light in it, too, which gave an unaccustomed
look to every familiar detail. The first thing she noticed was the chair
beside the fire, the old grandfather chair in which he had been sitting
only a few minutes before, resting after the effort of dressing&mdash;the
chair in which she had seen him sit and suffer so much and so bravely.
She would never see him there again, nor hear his voice&mdash;the kindest
voice she had ever heard. At his worst, it was always of her he thought,
of her comfort, of her fatigue; but all that was over now. He had gone,
and there could be no return&mdash;nothing could ever be as it had been
between them, even if they met again; but meet again they never would,
Beth knew, and at the thought she sank on the floor beside the senseless
chair, and, resting her head against it, broke down and cried the
despairing cry of the desolate for whom there is no comfort and no hope.</p>

<p>The fire she had lighted for Arthur to dress by had gone out; there were
no more coals. The remains of his breakfast stood on the table; she had
not touched anything herself as yet. But she felt neither cold nor
hunger; she was beyond all that. The chair was turned with its back to
the window, and as she cowered beside it, she faced the opposite
whitewashed wall. A ray of sunshine played upon it, wintry sunshine
still, crystal cold and clear. Beth began to watch it. There was
something she had to think about&mdash;something to see to&mdash;something she
must think about&mdash;something she ought to see to, but precisely what it
was she could not grasp. It seemed to be hovering on the outskirts of
her mind, but it always eluded her. However, she had better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span> not move
for fear of making a noise. And there was far too much noise as it
was&mdash;the wind rising and the waves breaking</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No, though; it was a procession of camels crossing the desert, and in
the distance was an oasis surrounded by palms, and there was white
stonework gleaming between the trees in the wonderful light. And those
great doors that opened from within? They were opening although she had
not knocked. She was expected, then&mdash;there, where there was no more
weariness, nor care, nor hunger. But that was not where she wished to
go. No! no! that did not tempt her.</p>

<p>"Take me where I shall not remember," she implored.</p>

<p>Poor Beth! the one boon she had to ask of Heaven at five-and-twenty was
oblivion: "Let me be where I shall forget."</p>

<p>Downstairs on the doorstep, Ethel Maud Mary and Gwendolen lingered a
while before they turned to follow Beth into the house, and, as they did
so, they noticed that a lady had stopped her carriage in the middle of
the road, jumped out impetuously, and was running towards them,
regardless of the traffic.</p>

<p>"That was Mrs. Maclure who was standing with you here just now and went
into the house?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"<i>Miss</i> Maclure," Ethel Maud Mary corrected her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss or Mrs., what does it matter?" the lady cried. "It was
Elizabeth Caldwell Maclure looking like death&mdash;where is she? Take me to
her at once!" She emphasised the request with an imperious stamp of her
foot.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Angelica, kneeling on the attic floor beside Beth,
cried aloud in horror, "Why, she is dead!"</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI"></a>CHAPTER LI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> warm morning when the apple-trees were out,
Arthur Brock was sitting
with Gresham Powell in the garden of the farm-house where they were
lodging in the country, turning over a portfolio full of Powell's
sketches, and Powell was looking at them over his shoulder, and
discussing them with him. Arthur had just come upon a clever study of
the head of a girl in a hat, and was looking hard at it.</p>

<p>"That's a study in starvation," Powell explained. "It's an interesting
face, isn't it? She came into a hairdresser's one day when I was there,
and sat down just in that attitude, and I sketched her on the spot. She
was too far through at the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
 to notice me. Look at her pretty hair
particularly. You'll see why in the next sketch, which is the sequel."</p>

<p>Brock took up the next sketch hurriedly. It was the same girl in the
same hat, but with her hair cut short.</p>

<p>"I asked the barber fellow about her when she'd gone," Gresham pursued.
"He'd taken her into an inner room, and when she came out she was
cropped like that. She told him she had come to her last shilling, and
she had an invalid at home depending on her entirely, and she entreated
him to give her all he could for her hair. I believe the chap did too,"
he seemed so moved by her suffering and gentleness. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Brock had risen abruptly with the sketches still in his hand. The colour
had left his face, and he looked as pinched and ill as he had done
during the early days of his convalescence.</p>

<p>"The matter!" he ejaculated. "I've just discovered what a blind fool I
am, that's what's the matter; and I'll keep these two studies with your
permission to remind me of the fact. Choose amongst mine any you like
instead of them, old chap, but these you must let me have."</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer, he took the sketches away with him into
the house. When he returned a short time afterwards, he was dressed for
a journey, and had a travelling bag in his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm going to town," he said, "to see the original of these sketches.
I've run up an account with her I shall never be able to settle, but at
all events I can acknowledge my debt, dolt that I am! <i>I</i> was that
invalid. And I thought myself such a gentleman too! not counting my
change and asking no questions, trusting her implicitly: that was my
pose from the day you came and poisoned my mind. Before that I had
neither trusted nor distrusted, but just taken things for granted as
they came, beautifully. I was too self-satisfied even to suspect that
she might be imposing her bounty upon me, starving herself that I might
have all I required, and sending me off here finally with the last penny
she had in the world. I told you I was wondering she did not answer my
letters. I expect she hadn't the stamp. But you said it was out of sight
out of mind, and she'd be trying it on with some one else in my absence.
If I'd the strength, I'd thrash you, Gresham, for an evil-minded
bounder."</p>

<p>"I'll carry your bag to the station, old chap," Gresham replied with
contrition, "and take the thrashing at your earliest convenience."</p>

<p>Ethel Maud Mary was standing on the steps in the sunshine looking out
when Arthur Brock arrived, just as she had stood to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span> watch him depart,
but in the interval a happy change had pleasantly transformed her. Her
golden hair was brightly burnished again, her blue eyes sparkled, and
her delicate skin had recovered its rose-leaf tinge. She wore a new
frock, a new ring, a new watch and chain, and there was a new look in
her face, one might say, as if the winter of care had passed out of her
life with the snow and been forgotten in the spring sunshine of better
prospects.</p>

<p>"O Mr. Brock!" she exclaimed; "you back! But none too well yet, judging
by appearances."</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs. Maclure?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew!" Ethel Maud Mary rejoined, becoming important all at
once. "She's gone for good, that's all I can tell you. O Mr. Brock!
fancy her being tip-top all the time, and us not suspecting it, though I
might have thought something when I saw the dresses she sold when you
were ill, only I'd got the fashion papers in my mind, and didn't know
but what she'd been paid in dresses! Come into the parlour; you look
faint."</p>

<p>"You said she sold her dresses?"</p>

<p>"Yes; sit down, Mr. Brock. A glass of port wine is what you want, as
she'd say herself if she was here; and you'll get it good too, for it's
been sent for Ma. My! the things that have come! Look at me&mdash;all
presents&mdash;everything she ever heard me say I'd like to have; and
Gwendolen the same."</p>

<p>She got out the wine and the biscuits from a chiffonier as she
chattered, and set them before him.</p>

<p>"Yes, she sold her dresses, and her rings, and her books, and every
other blessed thing she possessed except what had belonged to an old
aunt. She got <i>them</i> out too, one day, but cried so when it came to
parting with them, I persuaded her to wait. I said something would turn
up, I was sure. And something did, for <i>you</i> went away, and directly
after&mdash;the next minute, so to speak, for you were scarcely out of
sight&mdash;a lady stopped her carriage&mdash;a fine carriage and pair and
coachman and footman all silver-mounted&mdash;and ran up the steps in a great
way. She'd seen Mrs. Maclure go into the house, and she said she'd been
hunting for her everywhere for months, and all her friends were in a way
about her, not knowing what had happened to her. I took the lady up to
the attic, and there was Mrs. Maclure lying on the floor looking like
death, with her head up against the big chair where you used to sit. We
thought she <i>was</i> dead at first, but the doctor came and brought her
round. He said it was just exhaustion from fatigue and starvation."</p>

<p>Arthur Brock uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"You needn't reproach yourself, Mr. Brock," Ethel Maud Mary pursued
sympathetically. "You weren't worse than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span> rest of us. I saw her
every day, and never suspected she was denying herself everything, she
was always so much the same&mdash;happy, you know, in her quiet way."</p>

<p>"Do you think she was happy?" he groaned.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was happy," Ethel Maud Mary said simply. "She's that
disposition&mdash;contented, you know; and she was happy from the first; but
she was happier still from the time she had you to care for. I'd read
about ladies of that kind, Mr. Brock, but had not seen one before. It's
being good does it, I suppose. Do you know she'd not have told a lie was
it ever so, Mrs. Maclure wouldn't!"</p>

<p>"And she went away with that lady?" Arthur asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you can call it going," Ethel Maud Mary replied; "for the lady
didn't ask her leave, but just rolled her up in wraps, and had her
carried down to the carriage and took her off. And that's all we know
about her. She's written me a letter I'd like to show you, and sent me
money, pretending she owed it, because I'd let her have her attic too
cheap. She sent the presents afterwards, but no address. The lady came
back once alone, and had the attic photographed, with everything
arranged just as Mrs. Maclure used to have it. And she bought all the
things in it that belonged to us, and had them and all Mrs. Maclure's
own things taken away to keep, she said. She sat a long time in the
attic, looking at it, just as if she was trying to imagine what living
in it was like, and she kept dabbing her eyes with a little lace
handkerchief, and then she got up and sighed and said, 'Poor Beth! poor
Beth!' several times. She talked to me a lot about Mrs. Maclure. She
seemed to know all about me, and treated me as if we'd been old friends.
And she knew all about you too, and asked after you kindly. She said
Mrs. Maclure was going to be a great woman&mdash;a great genius or something
of that sort&mdash;and do a lot for the world; and she wanted to know if
you'd ever suspected it. I told her I thought not. The two letters you
wrote she took to give Mrs. Maclure, so she'd get <i>them</i> all right."</p>

<p>"And see the particular kind of fatuous ass I am set down clearly in my
own handwriting!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>Then he rose. "I'll just go up and look at the attics," he said.</p>

<p>Ethel Maud Mary waited below, and waited long for him. When at last he
came down, he shook hands with her, but without looking at her.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find that lady&mdash;Mrs. Maclure," he said, jamming his hat
down on his head, "if I have to spend the rest of my life in the
search."

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII"></a>CHAPTER LII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beth,</span> surrounded by friends, saw the spring come in that year at
Ilverthorpe, and felt it the fairest spring she could remember.
Blackbird and thrush sang in an ecstasy by day, and all night long the
nightingales trilled in the happy dusk. She did not ask herself why it
was there was a new note in nature that year, nor did she trouble
herself about time or eternity. Her eternity was the exquisite monotony
of tranquil days, her time-keepers the spring flowers, the apple-blossom
and quince, daffodil, wallflower, lilac and laburnum, the perfumed
calycanthus, forget-me-nots, pansies, hyacinths, lilies-of-the-valley in
the woods, and early roses on a warm south wall; and over all the lark
by day, and again at night the nightingale. In a life like hers, after a
period of probation there comes an interval of this kind occasionally, a
pause for rest and renewal of strength before active service begins
again.</p>

<p>While she had been shut up with Arthur, seeing no papers and hearing no
news, her book had come out and achieved a very respectable success, for
the sort of thing it was; and she was pleased to hear it, but not
elated. The subject had somehow lapsed from her mind, and the career of
the book gave her no more personal pleasure than if it had been the work
of a friend. Had it come out when it was first finished, she would have
felt differently about it; but now she saw it as only one of the many
things which had happened to her, and considered it more as the old
consider the works of their youth, estimating them in proportion, as is
the habit of age, and moderately rather than in excess. For the truth
was that a great change had come over Beth during the last few months in
respect to her writing; her enthusiasm had singularly cooled; it had
ceased to be a pleasure, and become an effort to her to express herself
in that way.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Cayley Pounce had been looking out for Beth's book, and,
while waiting for it to appear, he had, misled by his own suppositions,
prepared an elaborate article upon the kind of thing he expected it to
be. Nothing was wanting to complete the article but a summary of the
story and quotations from it, for which he had left plenty of space. He
condemned the book utterly from the point of view of art, and for the
silly ignorance of life displayed in it, and the absurd caricatures
which were supposed to be people; he ridiculed the writer for taking
herself seriously (but without showing why exactly she should not take
herself seriously if she chose); he pitied her for her disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
when she should realise where in literature her place would be; and he
ended with a bitter diatribe against the works of women generally, as
being pretentious, amateur, without originality, and wanting in humour,
like the wretched stuff it had been his painful duty to expose.
Unfortunately for him, however, the book appeared anonymously, and
immediately attracted attention enough to make him wish to discover it;
and before he found out that Beth was the author, he had committed
himself to a highly eulogistic article upon it in <i>The Patriarch</i>, which
he took the precaution to sign, that the coming celebrity might know to
whom gratitude was due, and in which he declared that there had arisen a
new light of extraordinary promise on the literary horizon. The book, as
it happened, was not a work of fiction at all.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Beth had heard nothing more from Dr. Maclure, and knew nothing about
him, except that he must have lost his degrading appointment, the Acts
having been rescinded. He had forwarded none of the letters her friends
had addressed to her at Slane. The Kilroys had endeavoured to obtain her
address from him, but he denied that he knew it. Unknown to her, Mr.
Kilroy, Mr. Hamilton-Wells, and Sir George Galbraith had taken the best
legal advice in the hope of getting her a divorce; but there was little
chance of that, as the acute mental suffering her husband had caused her
had merely injured her health and endangered her reason, which does not
amount to cruelty in the estimation of the law. The matter was therefore
allowed to drop, and Beth had not yet begun to think of the future, when
one day she received a letter from Dan, couched in the most affectionate
terms, entreating her to return to him.</p>

<p>"You must own that I had cause for provocation," he said, "but I confess
that I was too hasty. It is natural, though, that a man should feel it
if his wife gets herself into such a position, however innocently; and
the more he has trusted, loved, and respected his wife, the more violent
will the reaction be. I know, however, that I have had my own
shortcomings since we were married, and therefore that I should make
every allowance for you. So let us be friends, Beth, and begin all over
again, as you once proposed. I am ready to leave Slane and settle
wherever you like. Make your own conditions; anything that pleases you
will please me."</p>

<p>This letter upset Beth very much. She would almost rather have had an
action for divorce brought against her than have been asked to return to
Daniel Maclure.</p>

<p>"Ought I to go back?" she asked, willing, with the fatuous persistency
of women in like cases, to persevere if it were thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span> right that she
should, although she knew pretty well that the sacrifice would be
unavailing so far as he was concerned, and would only entail upon
herself the common lot of women so mated&mdash;a ruined constitution and
corroded mind.</p>

<p>"Why does he suddenly so particularly wish it?" was the question.</p>

<p>The obvious explanation was indirectly conveyed in a letter from her old
lawyer. He had written to her in her London lodgings, first of all, but
the letter was returned from the Dead Letter Office. Then he had written
to Slane, but as he received no answer to that letter and it was not
returned, he went in person to inquire about it. Dan declared that he
knew nothing about the letter, or about Beth either, if she had left
London; but he thought her intimate friends the Kilroys might know where
she was. The old gentleman applied to the Kilroys, and having found
Beth, wrote to inform her that her great-aunt Victoria Bench's
investments had recovered at last, as he had always been pretty sure
that they would, and she would accordingly, for the future, find herself
in receipt of an income of seven or eight hundred pounds a year. Dan's
sudden magnanimity was accounted for. Beth put his effusion and the
lawyer's letter before her friends, and asked to be advised. They
decided unanimously that, on the one hand, Dan was not a proper person
for her to live with, that no decent woman could associate with a man of
his mind, habits, and conversation without suffering injury in some
sort; while, on the other, they pointed out that, although it would be
nice, it would not be good for Dan to have the benefit of Beth's little
income. While he was forced to work, he would have to conduct himself
with a certain amount of propriety; but if Beth relieved him of the
necessity, there would be nothing to restrain him.</p>

<p>This episode roused Beth from her tranquil apathy, and made her think of
work once more. But first she had to settle somewhere and make a home
for herself; and although she had ample means for all her requirements
now, it was not an easy thing to find the special conditions on which
she had set her heart. The first impulse of a woman of noble nature is
to be consistent, to live up to all she professes to admire. As Beth
grew older, to live for others became more and more her ideal of
life;&mdash;not to live in the world, however, or to be of it, but to work
for it.</p>

<p>"I must be quiet," she said to Angelica one day when they were
discussing her future. "I am done for so far as work is concerned when I
come into contact with crowds. I want to live things then; I don't want
to think about them. Excitement makes me content to be, and careless
about doing. My truest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
 and best life is in myself, and I can only live
it in circumstances of tranquil monotony. People talk so much about
making the most of life, but their attempts are curiously bungling. What
they call living is for the most part more pain than pleasure to them;
for the truth is, that life should not be lived by men of mind, but
contemplated; it is the spectator, not the actor, who enjoys and
profits. The actor has his moment of applause, but all the rest is
misery. People rush to great centres to obtain a knowledge of life, and
do not succeed, for there they see nothing but broad effects. We find
our knowledge of life in individuals, not in crowds. There is no more
individuality in a crowd of people than there is in a flock of sheep.
All I know of life, of its infinite diversity, I have learnt here and
there from some one person or another, known intimately. A solitary
experience, rightly considered in all its bearings, teaches us more than
numbers of those incidents of which we see the surface only 'in the joy
of eventful living;' and, if the truth were known, I expect it would be
found that each one of us had obtained the most valuable part of our
experience in such homely details of simple unaffected human nature as
came under our observation in our native villages."</p>

<p>"Yes," Angelica answered thoughtfully, "the looker-on sees most of the
game. But I don't think you allow enough for differences of temperament.
You are thinking of the best conditions for creative work. You mustn't
lose sight of all the active service that is going on."</p>

<p>"No; but it is in retirement that the best preparation is made for
active service also. And I was thinking of active service more than of
creative work just then. The truth is, I am in a state of being
oppressed by the thought of my new book. I don't know what has come to
me. I am all fretty about it. Writing has lost its charm. I doubt if I
shall ever do well enough to make it worth while to write at all. And
even if I could, I don't think mere literary success would satisfy me. I
have tasted enough of that to know what it would be&mdash;a sordid triumph, a
mere personal thing."</p>

<p>"Ideala does not think that it is necessarily as a literary woman that
you will succeed," Angelica answered. "<i>I</i> thought it was because all
the indications you have given of special capacity seem to me to lie in
that direction. However, versatile people make mistakes sometimes. They
don't always begin with the work they are best able to do; but there is
no time lost, for one thing helps another&mdash;one thing is necessary to
another, I <i>should</i> say, perhaps. Your writing may have helped to
perfect you in some other form of expression."</p>

<p>"You cheer me!" Beth exclaimed. "But what form?" She reflected a little,
and then she put the puzzle from her. "It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
 will come to me, I dare say,"
she said, "if I shut the din of the world far from me, and sit with
folded arms in contemplation, waiting for the moment and the match which
shall fire me to the right pitch of enthusiasm. Nothing worth doing in
art is done by calculation."</p>

<p>"I think you are right to keep out of the crowd," said Angelica. "You
will get nothing but distraction from without. I should take one of the
privileges of a great success to be the right to refuse all invitations
that draw one into the social swim. Men and women of high purpose do not
arrive in order to be crowded into stuffy drawing-rooms to be stared
at."</p>

<p>"My idea of perfect bliss," Beth pursued, "when my work is done, and my
friends are not with me, is to lie my length upon a cliff above the sea,
listening to the many-murmurous, soothed by it into a sense of oneness
with Nature, till I seem to be mixed with the elements, a part of sky
and sea and shore, and akin to the wandering winds. This mood for my
easy moments; but give me work for my live delight. I know nothing so
altogether ecstatic as a good mood for work."</p>

<p>"What you call work is power of expression," said Angelica; "the power
to express something in yourself, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes," Beth answered, hesitating, as if the notion were new to her.
"I believe you are right. What I call work is the effort to express
myself."</p>

<p>Mr. Kilroy had come in while they were talking, and sat listening to the
last part of the conversation.</p>

<p>"I have just the sort of 'neat little cot in a quiet spot, with a
distant view of the rolling sea' that you yearn for, Beth," he said,
smiling, when she paused, "and I have come to ask you and Angelica to
drive over with me to see it."</p>

<p>"You mean Ilverthorpe Cottage," said Angelica, jumping up. "O Daddy!
it's the very place. Two storeys, Beth, ivy, roses, jasmine, wisteria
without; and within, space and comfort of every kind&mdash;and the sea in
sight! Such a pretty garden, too, grass and trees and shrubs and
flowers. And near enough for us all to see you as often as you wish.
Beth, be excited too! I must bring my violin, I think, and play a
triumphal march on the way."</p>

<p>Ilverthorpe Cottage was all and more than Angelica had said, and Beth
did not hesitate to take it. It was Mr. Kilroy's property, and the rent
was suspiciously low, but Beth supposed that that was because the house
was out of the way. She and Angelica spent long happy days in getting it
ready for occupation, choosing paper, paint, and furnishments. Mr.
Kilroy saw to the stables, which he completed with a saddle-horse and a
pony-carriage. There was a short cut across the fields, a lovely walk,
from Ilverthorpe House to the Cottage, and when Angelica could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
accompany her, Beth would stroll over alone to see how things were
getting on, and wander about her little demesne, and love it. Outside
her garden, in front of the house, the highroad ran, a sheltered
highroad, with a raised footpath, bordered on either side with great
trees, oak and elm, chestnut and beech, and a high hawthorn hedge just
whitening into blossom. The field-path came out on this highroad, down
which she had to walk a few hundred yards to her own gate. Day after day
there was an old Irish labourer, a stonebreaker, by the wayside,
kneeling on a sack beside a great heap of stones, who gave her a cheery
good-morrow as she passed. Once she went across the road and spoke to
him. He had the face of a saint at his devotions.</p>

<p>"You kneel there all day long," she said, "and as you kneel you pray,
perhaps. Will you pray for me? Pray, pray that I may"&mdash;she was going to
say succeed, but stopped&mdash;"that I may be good."</p>

<p>The man raised his calm eyes, and looked her in the face. "You <i>are</i>
good, lady," he said simply.</p>

<p>"Yet pray," she entreated; "and pray too that all I do may be good, and
of good effect."</p>

<p>"All you do is good, lady," he answered once more, in the same quiet
tone of conviction.</p>

<p>"But I want all I do to be the best for the purpose that can be done."</p>

<p>She put some money in his hand and turned away, and as she went he
watched her. She had touched him with her soft gloveless fingers in
giving him the money, and when she had gone, he was conscious of the
touch; it tingled through him, and he looked at the spot on which the
impression remained, as if he expected it to be in some sort visible.</p>

<p>"Now Our Lady love you and the saints protect you, bless your sweet
face," he muttered; "and may all you do be the best that can be done for
every one. Amen."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>A few months in her lovely little house sufficed to restore Beth's mind
to its natural attitude&mdash;an attitude of deep devotion. She even began to
work again, but rather with a view to making herself useful to her
friends than to satisfy any ambition or craving of her own. Whatever she
did, however, she approached in the spirit of the great musician who
dressed himself in his best, and prayed as at a solemn service, when he
shut himself up to compose. Beth had stepped away from the old forms by
this time. She had escaped from the bondage of the letter that killeth
into the realm of the spirit that giveth life. It is not faith in any
particular fetish that makes a mind religious, but the quality of
reverence. Churches Beth had come to look upon, not with distrust, but
with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
 indifference, as an ineffectual experiment of man's. She could
find no evidence of a holier spirit or a more divine one in the church
than in any other human institution for the propagation of instruction.
The church has never been superior to the times, never as far advanced
as the best men of the day, never a leader, but rather an opposer of
progress, hindering when ideas were new, and only coming in to help when
workers without had proved their discoveries, and it was evident that
credit would be lost by refusing to recognise them. There is no cruelty
the church has not practised, no sin it has not committed, no ignorance
it has not displayed, no inconsistency it has not upheld, from teaching
peace and countenancing war, to preaching poverty and piling up riches.
True, there have been great saints in the church; but then there have
been great saints out of it. Saintliness comes of conscientiously
cultivating the divine in human nature; it is a seed that is sown and
flourishes under the most diverse conditions.</p>

<p>Beth thought much on religion in those quiet days, and read much,
looking for spiritual sustenance among the garbage of mind with which
man has overlaid it, and finding little to satisfy her, until one night,
quite suddenly, as she sat holding her mind in the attitude of prayer,
there came to her a wonderful flash of illumination. She had not been
occupied with the point that became apparent. It entered her mind
involuntarily, and was made clear to her without conscious effort on her
part; but it was that which she sought, the truth that moves, makes
evident, makes easy, props and stays, and is the instigator of religious
action, the source of aspiration, the ground of hope&mdash;the which was all
contained for Beth in the one old formula interpreted in a way that was
new to her: <i>The communion of saints</i> (that inexplicable sympathy
between soul and soul), <i>the forgiveness of sins</i>, (working out our own
salvation in fear and trembling), <i>the resurrection of the body</i>
(reincarnation), <i>and the life everlasting</i> (which is the crown or
glory, the final goal).</p>

<p>"But God?" Beth questioned.</p>

<p>"God is love," she read in the book that lay open on the table before
her.</p>

<p>Then she clasped her hands over the passage and laid her head on them,
and for a long time she sat so, not thinking, but just repeating it to
herself softly: "God is love," till all at once there was a blank in her
consciousness; thought was suspended. When it returned, she looked up,
and in herself were the words: "God is Love&mdash;no! <i>Love is God!</i>"</p>

<p>In the joy of the revelation, she arose, and, going to the window, flung
it wide open. Far down the east the dawn was dimly burning; the faint
sweet breath of it fanned her cheeks;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
 her chest expanded with a great
throb, and she exclaimed aloud: "I follow, follow&mdash;<i>God</i>&mdash;I know not
where."</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Beth had a task before her that day which she did not relish in the
anticipation. She was going as a stopgap to speak at a large meeting to
oblige Angelica. She had the credit of being able to speak, and she
herself supposed that she could in a way, because of the success of her
first attempt; but she did not consent to try again without much
hesitation and many qualms, and she would certainly not have consented
had not her friends been in a difficulty, with no one at hand to help
them out of it but herself. But to be drawn from her hallowed seclusion
into such a blaze of publicity, even for once, was not at all to her
mind, and much of her wakefulness of the night before had been caused by
her shrinking from the prospect.</p>

<p>Late that night after the meeting she returned to her cottage alone,
cowering in a corner of the Kilroys' carriage. She was cowering from the
recollection of a great crowd that rose with deafening shouts and seemed
to be rushing at her&mdash;cowering, too, from the inevitable which she had
been forced to recognise&mdash;her vocation&mdash;discovered by accident, and with
dismay, for it was not what she would have chosen for herself in any way
had it occurred to her that she had any choice in the matter. There were
always moments when she would fain have led the life which knows no care
beyond the cultivation of the arts, no service but devotion to them, no
pleasure like the enjoyment of them,&mdash;a selfish life made up of
impersonal delights, such as music, which is emotion made audible,
painting, which is emotion made visible, and poetry, which is emotion
made comprehensible;&mdash;and such a life could not have been anything but
grateful to one like Beth, who had the capacity for so many interests of
the kind. She was debarred from all that, however, by grace of nature.
Beth could not have lived for herself had she tried. So that now, when
the call had come, and the way in which she could best live for others
was made plain to her, she had no thought but to pursue it.</p>

<p>The carriage put her down at her garden-gate, and she stood awhile in
the moonlight, listening to it as it rolled away with patter of horses'
hoofs and rattle of harness, listening intently as if the sound
concerned her. Then she let herself in, and was hurrying up to her room,
but stopped short on the stairs, cowering from the crowd that rose and
cheered and cheered and seemed to be rushing at her.</p>

<p>Her bedroom had windows east, west, and south, so that she had sunrise
and sunset and the sun all day. When she went in now, she found the
lamps lighted and all the windows shut, and she went round and flung
them open with an irritable gesture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
 Her nerves were overwrought; the
slightest contrariety upset her. The sweet fresh country air streamed in
and the tranquil moonlight. These alone would ordinarily have been
enough to soothe her, but now she paid no heed to them. When she had
opened the windows, she began to take off her things in feverish haste,
pacing about the room restlessly the while, as if that helped her to be
quicker. Everything she wore seemed too hot, too heavy, or too tight,
and she flung hat and cloak and bodice down just where she took them off
in her haste to get rid of them. Throwing her things about like that was
an old trick of her childhood, and becoming conscious of what she was
doing, she remembered it, and began to think of herself as she had been
then, and so forget her troubled self as she was at that moment&mdash;fresh
from the excitement and terror of an extraordinary achievement, a great
success. For she had spoken that night as few have spoken&mdash;spoken to a
hostile audience and fascinated them by the power of her personality,
the mesmeric power which is part of the endowment of an orator, and had
so moved them that they rose at last and cheered her for her eloquence,
whether they held her opinions or not. Then there had come friendly
handshakes and congratulations and encouragement; and one had said,
"Beth is launched at last upon her true career."</p>

<p>"But who could have thought that that was her bent?" another had asked.</p>

<p>Beth did not hear the answer, but she knew what it should have been. She
had been misled herself, and so had every one else, by her pretty talent
for writing, her love of turning phrases, her play on the music of
words. The writing had come of cultivation, but this&mdash;the last
discovered power&mdash;was the natural gift. Angelica had said that all the
indications had pointed to literary ability in Beth, but there had been
other indications hitherto unheeded. There was that day at
Castletownrock when Beth invited the country people in to see the house,
and, for the first time, found words flowing from her lips eloquently;
there were her preachings to Emily and Bernadine in the acting-room, of
which they never wearied; her first harangue to the girls who had caught
her bathing on the sands, and the power of her subsequent teaching which
had bound them to the Secret Service of Humanity for as long as she
liked; there was her storytelling at school, too, and her lectures to
the girls&mdash;not to mention the charm of her ordinary conversation when
the mood was upon her, as in the days when she used to sit and fish with
the bearded sailors, and held them with curious talk as she had held the
folk in Ireland, fascinating them. And then there was the unexpected
triumph of her first public attempt&mdash;indications enough of a natural
bent, had there been any one to interpret them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span></p>

<p>Beth, as she thought on these things, wandered from window to window,
too restless and excited to sit still; but, even occupied as she was,
after she had changed her dress the old trick came upon her, and she was
all the while observing.</p>

<p>It was autumn, and on the south she overlooked a field of barley,
standing in stooks, waiting to be carted. She noticed how the long,
irregular rows and their shadows showed in the moonlight. Across the
field the farm to which it belonged nestled in an apple-orchard. From
the east end of the house she obtained a glimpse of the sea, which was
near enough, for the drowsy murmur of it reached her even in calm
weather. To the west the highroad ran, and in her wanderings from window
to window Beth paused to contemplate it, to follow it in imagination
whither it led, to think of the weary way it was to so many weary feet,
to mourn because she could not offer rest and refreshment to every one
that passed.</p>

<p>The night was clear and the air was crisp, with a suspicion of frost in
it, such as sometimes comes in the late autumn. The moon was sinking,
and the stars shone out ever more brightly. Down in the roadway a little
brazier burned, where the road had been taken up and blocked for
repairs, and over the brazier the old watchman, who should have been
guarding the tools and materials that had been left lying about, dozed
in a sort of sentry-box. It occurred to Beth that the task was long and
dreary, and that the air grew chilly towards the dawn. Surely some food
would cheer and refresh him, and help to pass the time. She went down to
the pantry and got some, then carried it out on a tray. But the old man
was sound asleep, and, standing there in her long white wrapper, she had
to call him several times, "Old man! old man!" before she roused him.</p>

<p>He awoke at last with a start, and seeing the unexpected apparition in
the dim light, exclaimed, "Holy Mother! why have you come to me?"</p>

<p>Beth silently set the tray before him and slipped away, leaving him in
the happy certainty that a heavenly vision had been vouchsafed him.</p>

<p>But the moon set, the stars paled, and, from her window to the east,
Beth watched the dark melt to dusk, and the dusk pale to an even grey,
into which were breathed the burnished colours of the happy dawn. Then,
when the sun was high, and the accustomed sounds of life and movement
that held her ear by day had well begun, down the long road beneath the
old gnarled trees the postman came beladen, and there were brought to
her pamphlets, papers, cards, letters, telegrams, a fine variety of
praise, abuse, sympathy, derision, insults, and admiration. Quietly Beth
read, and knew what it meant, all of it&mdash;success! and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span> success she
had most desired: that her words should come with comfort to thousands
of those that suffer, who, when they heard, would raise their heads once
more in hope. In one paper that she opened she read: "A great teacher
has arisen among us, a woman of genius&mdash;" Hastily she put the paper
aside, burning with a kind of shame, although alone, to see so much said
of herself. Beth was one of the first swallows of the woman's summer.
She was strange to the race when she arrived, and uncharitably commented
upon; but now the type is known, and has ceased to surprise.</p>

<p>When she was dressed that morning, she went down to her bright little
breakfast parlour. Before her was the harvest-field, looking its
loveliest in the early morning sunlight. As she contemplated the
peaceful scene, she thought that she should feel herself a singularly
fortunate being. The dead would be with her no more, alas! except in the
spirit; but all else that heart could desire, was it not hers? The
answer came quick, No! Something was wanting. But she did not ask
herself what the something was.</p>

<p>The harvesters were not at work that morning, and she had not seen a
soul since she sat down to breakfast; but before she left the table, a
horseman came out from the farm, and rode towards her across the long
field, deliberately. She watched him, absently at first, but as he
approached he reminded her of the Knight of her daily vision, her
saviour, who had come to rescue her in the dark days of her deep
distress at Slane&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bowshot from her bower-eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He rode between the barley-sheaves."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The barley-sheaves!" suddenly Beth's heart throbbed and fluttered and
stood still. The words had come to her as the interpretation of an
augury, the fulfilment of a promise. It seemed as if she ought to have
known it from the first, known that he would come like that at last,
that he had been coming, coming, coming through all the years. As he
drew near, the rider looked up at her, the sun shone on his face, he
raised his hat. In dumb emotion, not knowing what she did, Beth reached
out her hands towards him as if to welcome him. He was not the Knight of
her dark days, however, this son of the morning, but the Knight of her
long winter vigil&mdash;Arthur Brock.</p>
